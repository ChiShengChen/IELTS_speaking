# Q1-1:
How do you usually spend your day at work?

# A1-1:
Usually, I spend my day at work working diligently and with focus. I do not like to mess around when I am at work. Of course, during my lunch break I will hang out with my colleagues and eat with them. However, when I am on the clock I am focused on my task and like to get all my work done efficiently.

# Q1-2:
Do you find it easy to organize your time at work?
# A1-2:
I find it quite easy to organize my time at work. I am fortunate enough to be able to work quite independently, therefore I have a lot of control over my duties and time management. This makes it very easy to be organized.

# Q2-1:
How do you usually spend your day when you’re studying?
# A2-1:
When I am studying, I need to break my day up into manageable tasks. I am not the sort of person who can study for 8 hours straight and then go home. I need to work on specific tasks for an hour or two and then go take a short break such as a walk outside or get a drink of water and talk with some friends. I find these breaks help me maintain focus and stay positive while I am working.

# Q2-2:
Do you find it easy to organize your study time?
# A2-2:
For the most part I find it easy to organize my study time, but sometimes I get distracted. In general, I have software development projects to focus on that require a lot of study. I am normally quite focused, but occasionally I slip up!

# Q2-3:
Who helps you most in your studies?
# A2-3:
I receive most of my help from my best friend. He also studies computer science and we often study together in the library. Often, I will help him with problems he does not understand, and he also helps me with problems I don’t understand.

# Q3-1:
What do you study?
# A3-1:
I am currently enrolled in the school of automation at my university. I am studying it as a broad subject, which means I explore everything from circuit design to mechanical principles. However, I would like to focus on automation design in my final year.

# Q3-2:
Have you always wanted to study this subject/these subjects?
# A3-2:
I became interested in these subjects after I graduated from high school. When I was a young child, I was very curious about the planets and stars. But when I got older, I found pursuing a career in astronomy was unrealistic and became interested in more practical fields, like the major I am studying now.

# Q3-3:
Do you study best in the morning or the afternoon?
# A3-3:
My most efficient study hours are definitely the morning. When I first wake up, I feel very driven and motivated to study hard and get on with my day. However, I normally push myself too hard and end up crashing by the
early afternoon.

# Q4-1:
Tell me about your hometown / where is your hometown?
# A4-1:
My hometown is the small town of Shantou, found on the eastern coast of Guangdong. Shantou was originally
a trading port and therefore the docks and ships are a very important aspect of the town for me. When I was a
kid I would go down to the docks and sit for hours watching the ships go by.

# Q4-2:
Did you learn about the history of your home town when you were at school?
# A4-2:
I learned a little about the history of my hometown when I was at school, but not a lot. We learned about the
foundation of Shantou as a trading port and its development from there. But mainly, we learn about larger cities.

# Q4-3:
What is your home town famous for today?
# A4-3:
I would say that my small town is most famous for the temples we have. There is both the Palace Temple of
Old Mother and the Temple of Emperor Guan, both of which attract a lot of tourists.

# Q5-1:
How often do you look at yourself in a mirror?
# A5-1:
I very rarely look at myself in a mirror. I am not a very vain（自视甚高） person and so I am not too
concerned with my own appearance. I only look at myself in a mirror when I really need to, such as
when I spill something on my face.

# Q5-2:
Have you ever bought a mirror?
# A5-2:
No, I have never bought a mirror. When I was growing up, there were already plenty of mirrors in my
house that my parents had bought. Since then, I have only rented accommodation that already had
mirrors on the walls.

# Q5-3:
Would you buy clothes without checking yourself in a mirror first?
# A5-3:
Yes, I often buy clothes without checking myself in the mirror first. For one, I often buy clothes online,
so it is literally impossible for me to check myself in the mirror first. Yet, even at stores if a piece of
clothing looks good, I trust it will look fine on me.


# Q5-4:
Do you think mirrors are a good way to decorate a room?
# A5-4:
I do not think mirrors are a good way to decorate a room. Mirrors are quite boring decorations when
compared to things such as paintings or wall hangings. When decorating a room, I would rather choose
decorations that are colourful and exciting.


# Q6-1:
How often do you take photos?
# A6-1:
I take photos very often! I use the camera on my phone, and I always have my phone on me（随身携
带手机）, so I take photos on a daily basis. I like to take photos with my friends, when I am at pretty
places and when I order good food!


# Q6-2:
Do you like taking photos of yourself?
# A6-2:
 I do not like taking photos of myself. I am not a very confident person and I get quite shy when I must
take a photograph of myself. So, I try to take as little photos of myself as possible.

# Q6-3:
Do you have a favorite family photo?
# A6-3:
 I do not have a favourite family photo. There are so many wonderful photos of my family that it is
impossible to choose just one that is my favourite! I like all my family photos; each one is lovely for
its own reasons.

# Q6-4:
Would you like to learn how to take better photos?
# A6-4:
 I would like to learn how to take better photos. I take a lot of photos but there is always room to
improve! It would be great to have a better understanding of lighting and shadow when it comes to
taking photos.

# Q7-1:
Did you enjoy travelling by car when you were a child?
# A7-1:
I really enjoyed travelling by car when I was a child! I would always get excited for long car journeys,
and I enjoyed watching the scenery pass by through the window. I would relish every car journey.

# Q7-2:
Would you generally prefer to be a driver or a passenger in a car
# A7-2:
Personally, I prefer being the passenger in a car rather than the driver. When I am in a car, I like
controlling the music, talking with my friends and enjoying the scenery. When you are driving you
must focus on the road, and you cannot enjoy these things.

# Q7-3:
How important is the colour of a car to you?
# A7-3:
The colour of a car is not important to me. I care more about a car’s specifications and features; I enjoy
good quality cars that drive well and are very fast! It does not matter to me what colour the car is.

# Q7-4:
What type of car would you most like to have in the future?
# A7-4:
In the future, I would like to have a very large car with a lot of space for people and luggage. I want a
car I can use for road trips and for camping, therefore I want one with a lot of space! I do not need a
flashy or a fast car.

# Q8-1:
What kinds of websites do you use most often?
# A8-1:
The websites I use most often are social media websites. I do not really use the internet much for
research or for my work, I prefer to use the internet for leisure and relaxation. So, the kinds of websites
I use most often are social media websites.

# Q8-2:
Do you prefer to get information from websites or books?
# A8-2:
 I prefer to get information from websites than from books. This is because researching on the internet
is so quick and easy to do! Finding information in books takes hours to look through pages and pages
of information. It is far quicker to search for things online.

# Q8-3:
Does your favorite website look the same now as when you first used it?
# A8-3:
Not at all! My favourite website is a social media website, and they are constantly updating the user
interface! The homepage is updated and changes every few years and other features, such as the chat
feature, are updated even more regularly.

# Q8-4:
Which is more important to you, what a website looks like or how easy it is to use?
# A8-4:
For me, the most important thing in a website is how easy it is to use. I find there are a lot of websites
that look brilliant but are really complicated and confusing to use! I like my websites to be simple,
effective, and easy to use.

# Q9-1:
What are the best things to buy at street markets in your country?
# A9-1:
The best thing to buy at street markets in my country is food! In China, the street food found in markets
is incredible! In fact, many of our street food dishes are so delicious they are famous worldwide! So,
food is by far the best thing to buy at street markets.

# Q9-2:
When was the last time you went to a street market?
# A9-2:
I have not been to a street market in quite some time, probably since last summer. I am quite busy and
so I don’t often have the time to visit street markets. It is something I like to do on special occasions
or when I am visiting friends.

# Q9-3:
Do you like going to street markets when you’re on holiday?
# A9-3:
I do like going to street markets when I am on holiday. There are street markets around the world, and
they are very different from country to country. Each country’s street markets sell unique food and
crafts! I like going to new places and seeing the different things they sell.

# Q9-4:
Which do you prefer: shopping at street market or shopping at a shopping centre?
# A9-4:
Personally, I prefer shopping at a shopping centre rather than at a street market. I find that shopping
centres are more convenient and easier to use. You can find everything you need at a shopping centre
while street markets normally have a very limited selection of products.

# Q10-1:
Do you enjoy watching sport on TV?
# A10-1:
 I do not enjoy watching sports on TV. Personally, I find sports quite boring, I have never been an
athletic person and I do not follow any sports teams. So, I find sports really boring to watch on TV.

# Q10-2:
Have you ever been to watch a live sports event [e.g. in a stadium]?
# A10-2:
No, I have never been to watch a live sports event. For one, I do not find sports very interesting so I
think a live sports event would be very boring to me. Moreover, tickets for live sports events are
normally very expensive!

# Q10-3:
Is there a sports event you might like to watch in the future?
# A10-3:
The only sport I am really interested in is tennis, so I would like to watch Wimbledon one day in the
future. Wimbledon is one of the most famed and celebrated tennis competitions, I think it would be
incredible to go see it in person.

# Q10-4:
Do you think it’s more enjoyable to watch sport alone or with other people?
# A10-4:
 I think it is more enjoyable to watch sports with other people. Most sports are competitive or team
sports, so there is always a social element to them. It is so much fun to get excited about a great sports
match with your friends!

# Q11-1:
Did you learn to draw or paint when you were younger?
# A11-1:
Yes, when I was a child, I learned how to draw and paint. I grew up in a very creative household and
my mother encouraged my siblings and I to draw from a very young age. So, I am quite skilled in both
drawing and painting.

# Q11-2:
Have you ever visited an art gallery?
# A11-2:
 Yes, I have visited many art galleries. Growing up my family and I would often go to art galleries and
museums on the weekends. Furthermore, whenever we were on holiday to a different town, we would
visit the galleries in that town as well!

# Q11-3:
Do you like looking at drawing or painting?
# A11-3:
Yes, I very much enjoy looking at drawings and paintings. I find most artworks beautiful and
mesmerizing. I love to look at the colours and the techniques of different artworks and appreciate the
skill of the artist.

# Q11-4:
Would you like to learn more about art in the future?
# A11-4:
 I always want to learn more about art! In the future I would love to learn more! I have always been
interested in learning more about western art and modern forms of art. There is so much for me to
learn!

# Q12-1:
What kind of lost things have you found in a public place?
# A12-1:
 I often find quite mundane items that people have lost in public places. A common example of lost
items I have found are umbrellas and gloves. People often leave these behind by accident on cold or
rainy days.

# Q12-2:
What would you do if you found something valuable, for example a phone?
# A12-2:
If I found something valuable like a phone in a public place, I would do my best to return it to its
owner. I would look around to see if anybody was looking for a lost phone, and if I could not find
anyone I would see if there was any way to contact the owner of the phone.

# Q12-3:
Have you ever lost something which was found by a stranger?
# A12-3:
Yes, I once lost my wallet, and it was returned to me by a stranger. I had left my wallet on the bus
when I was travelling home, and I thought it was probably lost for good! Luckily, I had a piece of
paper with my phone number in the wallet and a stranger called me to return it!

# Q12-4:
Would you ever ask for help on social media to find something you’d lost?
# A12-4:
No, I don’t think I would ever ask for help on social media to find something I’d lost. It is so unlikely
that anyone on social media would be able to help you. There are millions of people on social media,
the chances of finding the person who has your lost things is pretty low.

# Q13-1:
Is email popular with everyone in your country?
# A13-1:
Yes, I think email is quite popular with everyone in my country. People use email at school, at work,
and to send messages to their friends and family. Email is the quickest way to send a long message to
someone, so it is very popular.

# Q13-2:
Do you send a lot of emails?
# A13-2:
Yes, I send a lot of emails. I send many emails for my study and for my work, there are people I must
contact on a daily basis. On top of this, I also like to send emails to my friends and family who live in
different towns to me.

# Q13-3:
Do you prefer to email people or speak to them on the phone?
# A13-3:
Personally, I prefer to email people than to speak to them on the phone. I find that via email you get
much more detailed information and replies from people. Often on the phone you can get distracted or
forget what you have been told.

# Q13-4:
Do you think people will use email more or less in the future?
# A13-4:
I think people will use email more in the future. The world is becoming a more technologically focused
place and emails are at the heart of all technologically based industries. I think as the world develops,
we will send more and more emails.

# Q14-1:
What do you usually do in the morning [before starting your work or studies]?
# A14-1:
 In the mornings I like to relax and start my day slowly. I normally wake up and listen to some music
while I make a coffee and some breakfast. I am very tired in the mornings, so I do not like doing
anything that requires too much energy.

# Q14-2:
Do you prefer to go to bed early or late?
# A14-2:
I prefer going to bed late than going to bed early. I enjoy the evening a lot, I like spending it with my
friends, hanging out or watching TV. Therefore, I often go to bed quite late.

# Q14-3:
Do you like to do the same things every weekend?
# A14-3:
I do not like doing the same things every weekend. I think variety is very important in life, so during
my free time I like to try new things. Whether this is trying a new restaurant, watching a new movie,
or hanging out with new people!

# Q14-4:
Is your daily routine going to change in the future?
# A14-4:
I think my daily routine will change in the future. I am not the most productive person in the world,
and I think it would be better if I had healthier habits. So, I am going to try and improve my daily
routine in the future.

# Q15-1:
How often do you remember your dreams after you wake up?

when they wake up.

# Q15-2:
Do you like hearing about other people’s dreams?
# A15-2:
 I like hearing about other people’s dreams. I think dreams are very interesting and they can tell you a
lot about a person. So, I always find it fascinating to hear the strange and marvelous dreams of my
family and friends.

# Q15-3:
Do you think dreams can have special meanings?
# A15-3:
I think dreams can have special meanings. They say that dreams are related to our unconscious desires.
Therefore, I think dreams have the power to tell us things about ourselves that we do not consciously
realise.

# Q15-4:
Would you like to learn more about the subject of dreams?
# A15-4:
I would really like to learn more about the subject of dreams. Dreams are such a fascinating and
mysterious subject. We still do not fully understand what causes them or why they happen, I would
love to learn more about that.

# Q16-2:
Do you send many text messages?
# A16-2:
Yes, I send a lot of text messages, almost exclusively through WeChat. I have all my friends and family
on WeChat, and I find it a great way to stay in contact with people I have not seen in ages.

# Q16-3:
When did you first have a cell phone?
# A16-3:
I did not first get a cell phone until I was almost an adult. Growing up, my parents didn’t think a kid
should have a cell phone. They thought I should spend my time outside and playing with friends rather
than on a cell phone.

# Q16-4:
Are there any places where you would not use a cell phone?
# A16-4:
There are very few places where I would not use a cell phone. The only places I would not use my
cellphone are places where it is strictly forbidden to do so, such as at the cinema or in an exam hall.

# Q17-1:
Did you go to the cinema a lot when you were a child?
# A17-1:
No, I did not often go to the cinema when I was a child. As a family we preferred watching TV rather
than going to the cinema. It is more relaxing to stay home and watch a variety show!

# Q17-2:
Do you still like the same movies that you liked when you were a child?
# A17-2:
 I still like a lot of the same films that I liked when I was a child. Growing up I was a huge fan of action
films and sci-fi films and today these are still my favourite movies. For example, I love the Marvel
franchise.

# Q17-3:
Do you prefer to go to the cinema with friends or on your own?
# A17-3:
Personally, I prefer going to the cinema on my own. At the cinema I like to immerse myself in the film
and I find friends distracting. It is very relaxing going to the cinema alone, I do it often!

# Q17-4:
Which is more popular in your country: watching movies at movie theatre, or watching movies at
home?
# A17-4:
 I’d say it is more popular for people to watch movies at home than to watch movies at the movie
theatre in my country. This is mainly because streaming services are so convenient nowadays, so it is
possible to watch thousands of movies at home


# Q18-1:
What do you like about your work?
# A18-1:
My work is enjoyable because it allows me to be creative in my own way. I think programming is fun because
my job basically involves set challenges that I must solve with code. This lets me come up with interesting and
creative ways to solve problems.

# Q18-2:
What do you need to do your work better?
# A18-2:
To improve my efficiency at work what I need the most is a nice working environment. I would like to work in
a modern office with a comfy staff room and a decent coffee machine. A good environment like this would
really boost my mood.

# Q18-3:
How much time do you spend working every week?
# A18-3:
Programming is a well-paid job but it does require me to work overtime frequently. I have to spend too much
time working every week. I would say I spend around 10 to 12 hours working each day. It is tiring and
exhausting to continue this job.

# Q19-1:
What’s (the name of) your hometown?
# A19-1:
The name of my hometown is Beijing, it is a huge, vibrant city and the capital of China. I have lived here from
a very young age and feel very comfortable in my hometown. As one of the most populous（人口众多） in the world, Beijing has a large population. Therefore, there is a vast array of different people and cultures
which keeps my hometown constantly interesting.

# Q19-2:
Is that a big city or a small place?
# A19-2:
As it is the capital of China, Beijing is a very big city. So it is the industrial and economic heart of the country,
and throughout history many people have migrated（迁移） here from other parts of the country seeking
opportunity. Therefore, there are currently over 20 million people living in Beijing so it has to be very big to
accommodate everyone.

# Q19-3:
How long have you lived there?
# A19-3:
I have lived in Beijing almost all my life. I was actually born in Tianjin but my parents moved to Beijing when
I was a very young child, only a couple of years old. So it feels like I have lived in Beijing my entire life, so
almost two decades. I could not imagine living anywhere else.


# Q20-1:
Have you lived in your area for a long time?
# A20-1:
I have lived in Shanghai for a little while now, but not too long. I moved here around five years ago when my
father got a new job at one of the tech firms in the city. I am settled, but there are still a few places I don’t know
very well!

# Q20-2:
What do you like about the area where you live now?
# A20-2:
I think the best things about the area I live in now are the range of restaurants, shops, and events I have access
to. Each week, my family and I try a new type of food, we go to see the latest films, and we shop at all the
exciting stores in the mall.

# Q20-3:
Would you like to see any changes in the area you live?
# A20-3:
I would like to see some changes made to the city of Shanghai. It is a fun place to live, but it can be too busy!
The city is often very noisy and there is a real problem with litter and pollution. I think something should be
done about that!

# Q21-1:
Do you generally try to fix things when they stop working?
# A21-1:
I always try my hand at fixing things when they break or stop working properly. Most of the items we possess
have quite simple mechanisms and are not too tricky to fix yourself! In my opinion, it is an important life skill.

# Q21-2:
Do you think everyone should learn how to fix things in the home?
# A21-2:
Without a doubt I believe it is so important that people learn how to do general repair in the household. Nothing
lasts forever, and it is common for things to break or malfunction in your house. Learning to fix these things
yourself will save you so much time and money.

# Q21-3:
Did anyone teach you how to fix things when you were young?
# A21-3:
Yes, I was lucky that my father was quite a handyman and would always show me how he would fix objects
around the house. That way, I slowly learned how to repair loads of different household objects. I think these
were very valuable lessons.

# Q21-4:
What do you do with broken things?
# A21-4:
With broken things, my first response is to see if I can fix it. A lot of things I already know how to fix, and if
not, I will just watch a video online teaching me how to fix it. If I can’t fix it, I will donate it to someone who
can.

# Q22-1:
How often do you eat ice cream?
# A22-1:
I do not have a sweet tooth and so I don’t really eat ice cream that frequently. I like an ice cream on a very hot
day, but otherwise there are different desserts that I prefer, such as cakes and chocolates.

# Q22-2:
Would you like to try making ice cream?
# A22-2:
I have never had any interest in trying to make ice cream myself. It seems like a very complicated process and
I would probably end up making slop in the end instead of ice cream. I think I will leave ice cream making to
the professionals.

# Q22-3:
Is there a good place to buy ice cream where you live?
# A22-3:
No, there aren’t really any specific places to buy ice cream where I live. If I wanted ice cream I would have to
go to the supermarket and get it from the freezers there. I do not live in the warmest part of China so ice cream
is not very popular here.

# Q22-4:
Did you eat a lot of ice cream as a kid?
# A22-4:
I rarely ate ice cream when I was a kid. My parents were very healthy and they thought it was better if children
didn’t eat a lot of sugar. So, we only had ice cream on very special occasions.

# Q23-1:
Did you always pay attention in class when you were a kid?
# A23-1:
I was very attentive in the classroom when I was a child. My parents raised me with a lot of discipline and
taught me to always respect my elders. Therefore, I focused hard and listened to every word my teacher said
when I was in school.

# Q23-2:
Do you find it easy to concentrate in noisy places?
# A23-2:
I do not struggle to focus when I am in loud and distracting places. I have always been good at concentrating
no matter what the circumstances are. If the noise is really loud, I simply put on my headphones and listen to
music, then I can focus again.

# Q23-3:
Do you want a job that requires concentration?
# A23-3:
Having a job that requires concentration is my worst nightmare. I am continually distracted by things and find
it really difficult to stay on task longer than 15 minutes. I would rather have a job that requires less focus from
me.

# Q23-4:
What can you do to help you concentrate better?
# A23-4:
The thing I need to do to make sure I can focus is to remove all distractions from my environment. When it is
really important that I concentrate, I turn my phone off and find a quiet space by myself far away from my
friends and other distractions.

# Q25-1:
When you were a child, what job did you dream of doing?
# A25-1:
When I was growing up, I desperately wanted to become a scientist! Back then, I thought being a scientist was
a really beneficial and great profession for society. But as I grew up, I realized I might not be smart enough for
being a scientist, so I've given up on that idea now.

# Q25-2:
Do you think you are an ambitious person?
# A25-2:
I would not consider myself an ambitious person. I want to do well in life and succeed in some of my goals,
but I think too much ambition can be a bad thing. It is important to find a balance in life.

# Q25-3:
What kind of job do you want to do in the future?
# A25-3:
To be honest, I haven't figured out which industry I want to work in the future, but I hope to secure a stable job
without overtime requirements. It could be a regular corporate job or even a government position. Since I don't
have big ambitions and I love traveling, having enough free time and holidays is essential to me.

# Q25-4:
Do you have any dreams or hopes for your life?
# A25-4:
My dreams and hopes in life are simple. I want to get a good and stable job that brings me security. I want to
find someone I love and start a family with them. I want to live a happy life, that is all.


# Q26-1:
Did you like learning languages at school?
# A26-1:
I hated languages class when I was at school. I have always found languages really difficult to learn and the
classes were very stressful. They made me feel like I was stupid and bad at learning.

# Q26-2:
Which languages did you learn at school?
# A26-2:
When I was at school, I tried to learn English but I didn’t really manage to. The only language my school taught
was English and I had English classes for many years, but I never learned the language very well.

# Q26-3:
Is it a good idea to learn other languages?
# A26-3:
I think other languages are one of the most important and useful things to learn. Speaking multiple languages
not only increases your employability but it also opens up a whole new world of cultures and experiences to you!

# Q26-4:
Which language do you want to learn in the future?
# A26-4:
I have always wanted to learn Korean. I think Seoul is a fascinating city and Korea has a very unique and
interesting culture that I would like to explore. Also, a lot of my favourite music is sung in Korean!
