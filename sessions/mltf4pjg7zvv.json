    "What do you do with broken things?",
    "How important is the colour of a car to you?",
    "What kind of lost things have you found in a public place?",
    "Did you eat a lot of ice cream as a kid?",
    "Have you ever been to a zoo or safari park?"
  ],
  "sample_answers": [
    "With broken things, my first response is to see if I can fix it. A lot of things I already know how to fix, and if\nnot, I will just watch a video online teaching me how to fix it. If I can’t fix it, I will donate it to someone who\ncan.",
    "The colour of a car is not important to me. I care more about a car’s specifications and features; I enjoy\ngood quality cars that drive well and are very fast! It does not matter to me what colour the car is.",
    "I often find quite mundane items that people have lost in public places. A common example of lost\nitems I have found are umbrellas and gloves. People often leave these behind by accident on cold or\nrainy days.",
    "I rarely ate ice cream when I was a kid. My parents were very healthy and they thought it was better if children\ndidn’t eat a lot of sugar. So, we only had ice cream on very special occasions.",
    "Yes, I have been to many zoos and was even lucky enough to once visit a safari park with my parents. There is\na zoo in my home city, and growing up I would visit often. Once, my parents took me to the Guangzhou\nChimelong Safari Park as a reward for doing well in my exams."
