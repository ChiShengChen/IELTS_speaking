    "Oh, I could never forget the teachers I had in elementary school. Elementary school is such a formative stage\nof a person’s life and the teachers you had you would see every day. My teachers were probably some of the\nmost influential people in my childhood.",
    "Personally, I prefer shopping at a shopping centre rather than at a street market. I find that shopping\ncentres are more convenient and easier to use. You can find everything you need at a shopping centre\nwhile street markets normally have a very limited selection of products.",
    "I would not say it is easy for people in my country to keep healthy, it takes a lot of discipline. There are so many\nfatty foods and treats that are full of sugar. Also, most people work sat at a computer all day. So, it takes a lot\nof effort and willpower to stay fit.",
    "Yes, when I was a child, I learned how to draw and paint. I grew up in a very creative household and\nmy mother encouraged my siblings and I to draw from a very young age. So, I am quite skilled in both\ndrawing and painting."

So when I was a child, the elementary school was the first group of  at that time, I'm with every day, so I will remember in a long time.",
    "shopping street market or shopping center. I would prefer shopping and shopping center  is because shopping center has more choices than a street market has  when I need to buy a lot of stuff, clothing, so various categories  the shopping center will be the best choice than the street market.",
