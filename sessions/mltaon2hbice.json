  "transcript": "I'd like to talk about a special gift I'm planning to buy for my close friend, Edin.  We have long disorders since our university days.  So I'd say I know him inside out.  We share a lot of common interest, especially when it comes to Japanese culture and animation.  Even though I'm currently based in Boston and he's based in Taiwan,  we still spend a significant moment of time chatting online almost every week  and discussing the latest series or gaming news.  The game I have in my limited edition anime figure from a popular series with both adore.  I'm hoping to grab it in a major and many conventions as coming on soon.  This figure are quite rare and usually only available as a specific book during that event in the state.  Since I know he's been icing this particular character for a long time,  but couldn't find it anywhere, I think it would be the perfect surprise.  I really want to buy this for him because he has been such a  separated friend over the years.  For instance, when I was struggling with my research in university,  he was always there to listen and cheer me up, although it might be a bit expensive and  require me to dwell in a long queue at the convention. I believe it is worth the effort.",
