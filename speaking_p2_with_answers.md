- What kinds of things he/she talks about
- And explain why you follow this person regularly on social media or other media.

# A1-1:
I'd like to talk about a Japanese YouTuber I've been following for quite some time now. He's a travel vlogger who focuses on hidden gems in Tokyo and other major cities in Japan. I first stumbled across his channel about two years ago when I was looking for authentic ways to practice my Japanese listening skills.

His content is incredibly engaging because he doesn't just visit the typical tourist traps. Instead, he talks about local street food, quiet temples, and the unique atmosphere of different neighborhoods. He has this very natural way of speaking, which makes his videos perfect for language learners like me.

The main reason I follow him so regularly is that his videos actually inspired me to take a five-day trip to Tokyo with my friend YiLin last year. Before we left, I watched his guides over and over to plan our route. Although I've been to Japan before, his insights helped us discover places we would have otherwise missed. For instance, we explored some underground passages in Shinjuku that he'd recommended, which felt like navigating a maze. Even though I'm now back in Boston, I still tune in to his weekly uploads. It's a great way to keep my Japanese from getting rusty while also getting a little dose of travel inspiration during my busy research schedule.

# Q2-1:
Describe a person you know who does a job which is useful to society.
You should say:
- Who this person is
- What job this person does
- What skills this person needs to do the job
- And explain why you think this job is useful to society.

# A2-1:
I'd like to talk about an elderly lady who lives near my home in Taiwan, whom we affectionately call "阿罵". While she doesn't have a formal corporate title, she performs a role that I believe is incredibly useful to our local community. She essentially acts as a self-appointed community librarian and recycling coordinator.

Her "job" involves collecting old books from recycling bins, carefully sorting them out, and then redistributing them to people who need them, especially the kids in our neighborhood. To do this effectively, she needs a surprising range of skills. She has to be organized to categorize the books, but more importantly, she needs great interpersonal skills. She's an amazing storyteller, which helps her engage with the children and encourage them to read.

I think her work is vital for society because she promotes literacy and sustainability at a grassroots level. In today's world, where everything is becoming digital and disposable, she reminds us of the value of physical books and community sharing. What I find most fascinating is that even though her own children live in the US and she could easily move there, she chooses to stay because she finds it much more fulfilling to help her neighbors. Her dedication shows that you don't need a high-paying job to make a real difference in people's lives.

# Q3-1:
Describe a story someone told you that you remember well.
You should say:
- Who told you the story
- When this person told you the story
- What the story was about
- And explain why you remember this story well.

# A3-1:
The story I remember most vividly was told to me by my elderly neighbor, 阿罵, back in Taiwan. She told it to me a few months ago while we were sitting outside her house, sorting through some old books she had collected.

The story was about what our village, Mito, was like decades ago, long before it became the modern fishing village it is today. She described a time when there were no paved roads, and the entire community relied solely on the rhythm of the tides. She spoke about a particular storm that hit the coast when she was a young girl, and how the entire village came together to secure the fishing boats. Her description was so detailed that I could almost smell the salt air and hear the crashing waves she was talking about.

I remember this story so well because of her incredible gift for storytelling. She didn't just recount facts; she painted a picture of a way of life that is rapidly disappearing. As someone who now lives in a fast-paced city like Boston, hearing about the simplicity and resilience of the past was quite moving. It made me realize how much history is carried by the older generation. Every time I chat with her, I feel like I'm receiving a precious piece of our cultural heritage, which is why her words have stuck with me so clearly.

# Q4-1:
Describe an interesting discussion that you had with friends.
You should say:
- What the discussion was about
- What opinions you and your friends expressed
- What the result of the discussion was
- And explain why you found this discussion interesting.

# A4-1:
I'd like to talk about a really interesting discussion I had with my friends last year while we were planning a trip to a major anime convention in Taipei. We've been going to these events since we were teenagers, but this particular conversation stood out because we had to be very strategic about our visit.

The discussion was mainly about how to navigate the venue, which we knew would be absolutely packed, like a sea of people. We debated which booths were the highest priority and which limited-edition figures were worth the wait. One of my friends was quite hesitant about the cost, but I expressed the opinion that we should invest in VIP early-bird passes. I argued that although they were expensive, getting in an hour early would be totally worth it to avoid the massive queues and grab the exclusive merchandise we wanted.

In the end, we reached a consensus and decided to go for the VIP tickets. The result was fantastic because we managed to see everything on our list without the usual stress of being lost in the crowds. I found this discussion interesting because it wasn't just about anime; it was about collective decision-making and balancing a budget against the quality of an experience. It also showed how much we value our shared hobbies, even as we've grown older and have more responsibilities.

# Q5-1:
Describe a person that you enjoy spending time with.
You should say:
- How you met this person
- What type of person he/she is
- What you have done together
- And explain why you enjoy spending time with this person.

# A5-1:
A person I truly enjoy spending time with is my close friend, YiLin. We first met during our undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University, where we bonded over our shared interest in technology and travel.

YiLin is the kind of person who is incredibly adventurous yet very organized, which makes her the perfect travel companion. She's also a very thoughtful listener, which I really appreciate given my often hectic research schedule. We've done many things together over the years, but the highlight was definitely our five-day trip to Tokyo last year. We spent hours exploring different neighborhoods, trying local street food, and even taking a hands-on cake-making class at a small studio. We even got lost together in the maze-like Shinjuku station, but instead of getting stressed, we just laughed about it.

I enjoy her company because we have a great balance in our friendship. Whether we are discussing complex topics like quantum machine learning or just wandering through a fishing village like my hometown, Mito, the conversation always flows naturally. She has a way of making even the most mundane activities feel like an adventure. Now that I'm based in Boston, we don't see each other as often as I'd like, but whenever we do catch up, it feels like no time has passed at all.

# Q6-1:
Describe a person you only met recently who you would like to get to know better.
You should say:
- Who this person is
- Where you met him/her
- What you talked about
- And explain why you would like to get to know this person better.

# A6-1:
I'd like to talk about my neighbor, an elderly lady we call 阿罵, whom I've only really started talking to since I returned home for a visit recently. Although she's lived near my family for years, I never had the chance to properly sit down and chat with her until a few weeks ago.

We met properly outside her house, where she was busy sorting through a pile of old books she'd rescued from recycling bins. We ended up talking for nearly an hour about the history of our village, Mito. She told me these incredibly vivid stories about what the coastal path and the fishing harbor looked like decades ago, long before the modern developments. She also mentioned how she enjoys her life in Taiwan despite her children living far away in the United States.

I would like to get to know her better because she is a walking encyclopedia of local history and a master of the art of storytelling. Every time we speak, I feel like I learn something new about my own roots. Moreover, her positive outlook on life and her dedication to helping the neighborhood kids by providing them with books is truly inspiring. I feel like she has so many more stories that I haven't heard yet, and I'd love to record some of them to preserve the heritage of our fishing village.

# Q7-1:
Describe a time when something in your home broke and you tried to repair it.
You should say:
- What thing broke
- Why this thing broke
- What you did to try to repair it
- And explain how successful you were at trying to repair this thing.

# A7-1:
I'd like to talk about a time I had to repair my Nintendo Switch. I've had the console for a few years, and it's my favorite way to unwind on weekends. However, a few months ago, the left joystick started drifting really badly, which means the characters in my games would move on their own even when I wasn't touching the controller.

I think it broke simply due to wear and tear, as I use it quite frequently, especially when my younger cousins come over during holidays. Instead of sending it away for an expensive and time-consuming professional repair, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I went online and watched several detailed YouTube tutorials to understand the internal structure of the device. Then, I ordered a small specialized screwdriver kit specifically designed for electronics.

The repair process was quite nerve-wracking because the components are so tiny and delicate. I had to carefully open the casing, disconnect some very thin ribbon cables, and replace the joystick module. It took me about an hour of intense focus, but I'm happy to say I was completely successful. The drift disappeared entirely, and the controller felt as good as new. I felt a great sense of accomplishment afterwards, not just because I saved money, but because I'd managed to fix a piece of technology that I use every single day.

# Q8-1:
Describe a useful skill you learned from an older person.
You should say:
- Who the other person was
- What skill you learned from this older person
- How easy or difficult it was to learn this skill
- And explain why it was useful for you to learn this skill.

# A8-1:
The person I learned a very useful skill from is my elderly neighbor in Taiwan, whom we call 阿罵. The skill she taught me wasn't a technical one, but rather the art of storytelling. Whenever I visit her, she shares these incredibly vivid tales about our fishing village, Mito, and I became fascinated by how she could hold an audience's attention so effortlessly.

Learning this was actually quite challenging. It's not just about the words you use, but also about the pacing, the tone of voice, and how to describe small details to make a scene come alive. She showed me how to focus on sensory details—like the smell of the sea or the color of the sunset over the harbor—to make the listener feel like they are actually there. It took many afternoons of sitting with her and practicing before I started to get the hang of it.

This skill has been immensely useful for me, especially in my professional life as a researcher. Whether I'm presenting my work on EEG analysis at a conference or just explaining complex concepts to colleagues in Boston, being able to structure information as a compelling narrative makes a huge difference. It helps people stay engaged and remember the key points. Beyond that, it's helped me connect more deeply with my own family history, allowing me to pass on stories to the younger generation just as she did for me.

# Q9-1:
Describe a place in the countryside that you enjoyed visiting.
You should say:
- Where you went in the countryside
- Why you went to this place in the countryside
- What you saw and did there
- And explain why you enjoyed visiting this place in the countryside.

# A9-1:
One of my favorite places in the countryside is my hometown, Mito, which is a small, traditional fishing village located on the coast of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. I try to go back there whenever I need a break from the hustle and bustle of city life, especially now that I'm living in a busy place like Boston.

The main reason I visit is to walk along the coastal path that stretches from the village all the way to the nearby fishing harbor. It's a peaceful hour-long walk that I've been doing since I was a child. Along the way, you can see rows of fishing boats lined up on the shore and locals drying fish on wooden racks by the side of the road. The best part is definitely the late afternoon, when you can watch the sunset turn the sky into brilliant shades of orange and red over the ocean.

I enjoyed visiting this place because it offers a sense of simplicity and tranquility that is hard to find elsewhere. The air always smells like the sea, and the only sounds you hear are the waves and the seagulls. It's a complete contrast to the crowded anime conventions or the high-tech labs I usually spend my time in. Walking that path helps me clear my head and reminds me of my roots. It's a place where time seems to slow down, and I always leave feeling refreshed and grounded.

# Q10-1:
Describe a time that you remember being in a new place.
You should say:
- Where you were
- Why you were in the new place
- What you remember about it
- And explain how you felt about being in this new place.

# A10-1:
I remember very clearly the first time I visited Tokyo, Japan. I went there for a five-day trip with my close friend YiLin. The reason we chose Tokyo was that I'd been following a Japanese YouTuber for a long time to practice my language skills, and his videos made the city look absolutely fascinating.

What I remember most vividly was the sheer scale and complexity of the city, particularly Shinjuku Station. It felt like a massive underground maze with endless exits and passages. I also remember the contrast between the high-tech, neon-lit streets and the quiet, traditional temples tucked away in small alleys. We even took a hands-on cake-making class in a tiny studio, which was a much more intimate experience compared to the crowded streets outside.

Initially, I felt quite overwhelmed by the sea of people and the constant noise, which was a huge change from the quiet fishing village where I grew up. However, as we started exploring different neighborhoods and trying the local street food, my anxiety turned into pure excitement. Although we got lost several times, the sense of discovery was exhilarating. By the end of the trip, I felt a real connection to the city, and it even made me consider the possibility of living in Japan someday. It was a transformative experience that really broadened my horizons.

# Q11-1:
Describe a long walk that you enjoyed.
You should say:
- Where and when you went on the walk
- Who you went with
- What you saw on the walk
- And explain why you enjoyed this long walk.

# A11-1:
I'd like to talk about a long walk I took along the coast near my hometown, Mito, which is a small fishing village in Kaohsiung. This happened during my last visit home over the lunar new year. I went on this walk with my family, which is a tradition we've kept up since I was quite young.

The path we took stretches from the edge of our village all the way to the main fishing harbor, and it usually takes about an hour or so at a leisurely pace. As we walked, we saw the local fishermen preparing their nets and rows of boats bobbing in the water. One of the most iconic sights was the locals drying fish on large racks along the road, which gives the whole area a very distinct, salty aroma. We timed our walk perfectly to catch the sunset, and seeing the sky turn a deep crimson over the ocean was absolutely breathtaking.

I enjoyed this walk because it provided a rare opportunity to disconnect from technology and spend quality time with my loved ones. In my daily life in Boston, I'm usually surrounded by computers and research papers, so being out in the fresh sea air was incredibly rejuvenating. The rhythmic sound of the waves and the simple, peaceful atmosphere of the village always help me put things into perspective. It's a walk that reminds me of where I came from and allows me to appreciate the natural beauty of my home.

# Q12-1:
Describe a famous city that you find interesting.
You should say:
- Where the city is
- How you know about the city
- Why the city is famous
- And explain why you find this city interesting.

# A12-1:
A famous city that I find absolutely fascinating is Tokyo, the capital of Japan. I first became interested in it through a Japanese YouTuber I follow, whose videos about the city's hidden spots inspired me to visit it myself. Last year, I finally had the chance to go there for a five-day trip with my friend YiLin.

Tokyo is famous for many things, ranging from its cutting-edge technology and vibrant pop culture to its world-class cuisine. It's a city where you can find ancient shrines standing right next to futuristic skyscrapers. It's also well-known for its incredibly efficient, yet complex, public transport system—I still remember how we got completely lost in the maze of Shinjuku Station, which is one of the busiest in the world.

What I find most interesting about Tokyo is this unique blend of the old and the new. One moment you can be in a crowded, neon-lit district like Shibuya, and the next, you can be participating in a quiet, hands-on cake-making class in a traditional neighborhood. The attention to detail in everything, from the street food to the architecture, is truly impressive. Although it can be overwhelming at times due to the sheer number of people, the city has an energy that is contagious. My visit there was so memorable that I've even thought about living there for a while to further my research in a different cultural setting.

# Q13-1:
Describe an occasion when you had a cake that was special.
You should say:
- What kind of cake it was
- Why you had this cake
- Who you were with
- And explain how you felt about having this special cake.

# A13-1:
I'd like to talk about a very special cake I had during my trip to Tokyo last year. It wasn't a cake I bought from a famous bakery, but rather one that I made myself. It was a traditional Japanese strawberry shortcake, known for its light sponge and fresh cream.

The occasion was a hands-on cake-making class that I attended with my close friend, YiLin. We had been exploring different neighborhoods in Tokyo and decided to try something a bit more interactive than just sightseeing. The class was held in a charming little studio, and the instructor guided us through every step, from whisking the eggs to carefully decorating the top with fresh fruit.

I felt a great sense of joy and accomplishment while having this cake. Because I had put so much effort into making it, every bite tasted much better than any store-bought dessert. It was also a wonderful bonding experience with YiLin; we laughed quite a bit when our initial attempts at piping the cream looked a bit messy. In the middle of a busy trip where we often felt overwhelmed by the crowds in places like Shinjuku, this quiet afternoon in the studio was a highlight. It made me realize how much I enjoy the process of creating something with my own hands, and it's a memory I still cherish now that I'm back in Boston.

# Q14-1:
Describe a time when you received something without having to pay for it.
You should say:
- What this free thing was
- Why it was free
- What you did to get this free thing
- And explain how you felt about receiving this free thing.

# A14-1:
I'd like to talk about a time I received a limited-edition promotional T-shirt for free. This happened last year when I attended a large anime convention in Taipei with a group of friends. We are all huge fans of Japanese animation, so we had been planning this trip for weeks.

The T-shirt was free because it was part of a marketing campaign for a new series that was being launched at the event. To get it, I had to visit a specific booth early in the morning and participate in a small interactive game they were hosting. Because I had made the decision to buy a VIP early-bird pass, I was able to get into the venue an hour before the general public, which gave me a huge advantage in reaching the booth before the T-shirts ran out.

I felt incredibly excited and lucky to receive it. The convention was absolutely packed, like a sea of people, and seeing so many other fans trying to get the same item made me appreciate my VIP pass even more. The shirt itself has a really cool design, and every time I wear it, it reminds me of the fun time I had with my friends. It's not just about the monetary value of the item, but rather the experience of being part of a community and the effort I put into being there at the right time. It's definitely one of my favorite souvenirs from that trip.

# Q15-1:
Describe a time when you were preparing for a happy event.
You should say:
- What the event was
- How you prepared for this event
- Who helped you prepare for it
- And explain how successful your preparations for this event were.

# A15-1:
A happy event I remember preparing for was a major anime convention that took place in Taipei last year. This is something my friends and I look forward to every year, as it's a chance for us to celebrate our shared hobby and see the latest releases in the industry.

The preparations were quite extensive and took several weeks. We had to coordinate our schedules, which was a bit tricky because one of our friends couldn't get time off work, which was a real shame. My friend YiLin and I spent a lot of time checking which booths we wanted to visit and making a list of limited-edition merchandise we hoped to grab. I also spent a significant amount of time researching the ticket options and eventually decided to buy a VIP early-bird pass to ensure we could get in before the crowds.

Overall, I would say our preparations were highly successful. Because we had a clear plan, we didn't get as overwhelmed by the sea of people as we usually do. We managed to find all the specific booths we were looking for, even though the venue was massive and felt like a maze at times. Getting the VIP pass was definitely the right call, as it allowed us to secure some exclusive items that sold out within minutes of the general opening. It was a fantastic weekend, and the effort we put into the planning made the actual event much more enjoyable and stress-free.

# Q16-1:
Describe the kind of house or apartment you would like to live in.
You should say:
- Where this house or apartment would be
- What it would look like
- What would be special about the house or apartment
- And explain why you would like to live in this house or apartment.

# A16-1:
My ideal home would be a small, modern house located right on the coast near my hometown, Mito, in Taiwan. Although I currently live in a busy city like Boston for my research, I've always dreamed of returning to the peaceful atmosphere of the fishing village where I grew up.

The house would have a very minimalist design, with large floor-to-ceiling windows to let in plenty of natural light. I'd want it to be built with sustainable materials, blending in with the coastal landscape. The most special feature would be a large wooden deck overlooking the ocean, where I could sit and watch the sunset every evening, just like I used to do with my family when I was younger. I'd also have a dedicated space for my research and a small workshop where I could work on DIY projects, like fixing my electronics.

I would like to live in this house because it represents a perfect balance between my professional interests and my personal well-being. Being near the sea has always had a calming effect on me; the sound of the waves and the salty air help me stay focused and creative. After years of living in crowded cities and attending busy events like anime conventions, the idea of having a quiet sanctuary in the countryside is incredibly appealing. It would be a place where I could stay connected to my roots while still pursuing my passion for technology and science.

# Q17-1:
Describe an item of clothing that someone gave you.
You should say:
- What the item of clothing was and who gave it to you
- What it looked like
- When you wore it
- And explain why this person gave you this item of clothing.

# A17-1:
I'd like to talk about a special T-shirt that my friend YiLin gave me last year. It's a high-quality cotton tee featuring a unique, stylized illustration of a character from one of our favorite anime series.

The shirt is a deep navy blue, and the artwork on the front is quite subtle and artistic, rather than being a loud, typical promotional item. It has a very modern, streetwear feel to it, which I really like because it's versatile enough to wear in different settings. I remember wearing it for the first time when we went to a large anime convention in Taipei together. The venue was absolutely packed, and I felt quite proud to be wearing something so unique while we were navigating through the sea of people.

YiLin gave me this shirt as a surprise gift just before our trip. She knew I had been working really hard on my research at Harvard and that I was feeling a bit burnt out. She wanted to give me something that would get me excited for our upcoming holiday and remind me of our shared hobby. It was a very thoughtful gesture that I truly appreciated. Now, whenever I wear it, it not only reminds me of that fantastic trip to the convention but also of the strong friendship we've built over the years. It's more than just a piece of clothing to me; it's a symbol of support and shared memories.

# Q18-1:
Describe a toy that you often played with as a child.
You should say:
- What kind of toy it was
- How old you were when you got it
- Whether you played with the toy by yourself or with other people
And explain how you felt about this toy.

# A18-1:
I'd like to talk about a handmade toy from my childhood, which was a rubber band gun. Growing up in a small fishing village called Mito in Kaohsiung, we didn't have many fancy store-bought gadgets, so we often made our own fun. I remember I was about eight or nine years old when my dad helped me construct this masterpiece using just some scrap wood, a few nails, and a handful of sturdy rubber bands.

It wasn't just a solo activity. In fact, I almost always played with the neighborhood kids. We would gather in the narrow alleys behind our houses and have these epic "wars." We'd split into teams, hide behind old crates or fishing nets, and try to "tag" each other with the rubber bands. It was incredibly exciting and kept us active for hours until our parents called us home for dinner.

Looking back, I felt extremely proud of that toy because it wasn't something you could just buy in a shop. Because my father helped me build it, it felt special and unique. Moreover, it really sparked my creativity, as we were always trying to find ways to improve the range or the accuracy of our "weapons." Even though it was just a simple piece of wood, it provided some of the most joyful and memorable moments of my early years, teaching me the value of making things with my own hands.

# Q19-1:
Describe a gift you would like to buy for a friend.
You should say:
- How well you know this friend
- How much time you spend with him/her
- What type of gift you would like to buy him/her
And explain why you would like to buy this gift for your friend.

# A19-1:
I'd like to talk about a special gift I'm planning to buy for my close friend, YiLin. We've known each other since our university days at NTU, so I'd say I know him inside out. We share a lot of common interests, especially when it comes to Japanese culture and animation. Even though I'm currently based in Boston and he's back in Taiwan, we still spend a significant amount of time chatting online every week, discussing the latest series or gaming news.

The gift I have in mind is a limited-edition anime figure from a popular series we both adore. I'm hoping to grab it at a major anime convention that's coming up soon. These figures are quite rare and usually only available at specific booths during the event. Since I know he's been eyeing this particular character for a long time but couldn't find it anywhere, I think it would be the perfect surprise.

I really want to buy this for him because he's been such a supportive friend over the years. For instance, when I was struggling with my research at Harvard, he was always there to listen and cheer me up. Although it might be a bit expensive and require me to wait in a long queue at the convention, I believe it's worth the effort. Seeing his reaction when he finally adds it to his collection would be incredibly rewarding for me, as it's a way to celebrate our long-standing friendship.

# Q20-1:
Describe something you did that helped you to learn another language.
You should say:
- What you did
- Where you did it
- Who you did it with
And explain how doing this helped you to learn another language.

# A20-1:
To be honest, one of the most effective things I did to improve my English was incorporating listening practice into my daily commute. While I was living in Taiwan and traveling to the university every morning, I made it a habit to listen to various English podcasts. I usually did this alone, as it was my private time to focus, but I'd often discuss the topics later with my classmates or my friend YiLin to practice speaking.

I relied heavily on my noise-cancelling earphones during these sessions. Because the subway and buses in Taipei can be quite noisy, having that "personal bubble" was essential for me to hear the nuances of the language clearly. I would listen to everything from daily news to technical discussions about machine learning, which is my field of research.

This routine helped me immensely because it exposed me to natural, conversational English that you don't always find in textbooks. By listening to different accents and speeds every single day, my listening comprehension improved significantly over a few months. Furthermore, it helped me pick up useful discourse markers and idiomatic expressions naturally. Although it felt like a small effort at first, the cumulative effect was huge. It gave me the confidence I needed when I eventually moved to Boston for my research, as I felt much more comfortable engaging in real-life conversations with native speakers.

# Q21-1:
Describe a song that you think is interesting.
You should say:
- What country the song is from
- How you know about the song
- What the song is about
And explain why you think this song is interesting.

# A21-1:
I'd like to talk about a song that I find absolutely fascinating, which is actually the opening theme from one of my favorite Japanese anime series. As you might guess, the song is from Japan. I first discovered it while attending a massive anime convention in Taipei last year. They played it on the main stage during a promotional event, and the energy in the room was just incredible.

The song itself is quite upbeat and energetic, which is typical for the genre. However, the lyrics are what really caught my attention. It's essentially about perseverance and the importance of never giving up on your dreams, even when things get tough. It tells a story of a character who faces numerous setbacks but continues to push forward with the help of his friends.

I think this song is interesting because of the way it blends a catchy, modern melody with such a deep and meaningful message. Whenever I'm feeling stressed with my work at the lab or feeling a bit homesick here in Boston, I put on my earphones and listen to this track. It has this unique ability to instantly boost my mood and give me a fresh burst of motivation. Moreover, it reminds me of the great times I had at the convention with my friends. Even though I don't understand every single word of the Japanese lyrics, the emotion and the power behind the music are truly universal.

# Q22-1:
Describe an ambition you haven't achieved yet.
You should say:
- What your ambition is
- Why you want to achieve this ambition
- How long you have had this ambition
And explain why you haven't achieved this ambition yet.

# A22-1:
An ambition that I've been harboring for quite a while now is to attend the San Diego Comic-Con in the United States. For an anime and pop culture enthusiast like me, this is basically the "holy grail" of events. I've had this dream since I was a teenager back in Taiwan, watching clips of the massive panels and incredible cosplays online.

The reason I'm so keen on going is that it's the largest event of its kind in the world. I want to experience that vibrant atmosphere firsthand, meet some of my favorite creators, and perhaps even get my hands on some exclusive merchandise that you can't find anywhere else. It's not just about the shopping, though; it's about being part of a global community that shares the same passions.

However, I haven't been able to achieve this goal yet for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the tickets are notoriously difficult to get; they usually sell out within minutes, and it's almost like a lottery. Secondly, because I've been so focused on my academic career and my research at Harvard, I haven't had the luxury of taking a full week off during the summer when the event takes place. In addition, the cost of travel and accommodation in San Diego during that week is quite astronomical. Nevertheless, I'm determined to save up and keep trying for tickets, as it's a "bucket list" item that I'm not willing to give up on.

# Q23-1:
Describe a rule (e.g. at school or work) you dislike and would like to change.
You should say:
- What the rule is
- What the reason for the rule is
- Why you dislike the rule
And explain how you would like to change the rule.

# A23-1:
I'd like to talk about a specific policy at my previous workplace that I found quite frustrating, which was the extremely strict leave-request system. Basically, we had to submit any requests for time off at least two months in advance, and there were many "blackout dates" where no one was allowed to take leave at all.

The official reason for this rule was to ensure that the department always had enough staff to handle the workload and to prevent any sudden disruptions to our research projects. While I understand the need for organization, I felt the execution was far too rigid.

I particularly disliked this rule because it made it nearly impossible to attend events that were announced on shorter notice. For example, last year I wanted to go to a major anime convention with my friends, but because the dates were confirmed only six weeks prior, my request was flatly denied. It felt like I had no flexibility or work-life balance. Moreover, it created a lot of unnecessary stress among the team.

If I could change this rule, I would implement a more flexible, "trust-based" system. Instead of a hard two-month deadline, I'd suggest a two-week notice period for shorter leaves. I would also introduce a system where team members could coordinate with each other to cover shifts, rather than having the management impose blanket bans on certain dates. I believe that giving employees more autonomy would actually lead to higher productivity and a much happier working environment.

# Q24-1:
Describe something you can't live without – not a mobile/cell phone or computer.
You should say:
- What this thing is
- What you use it for
- How long you have had it
And explain why you can't live without this thing.

# A24-1:
If I had to pick one item that I absolutely cannot live without—aside from the obvious ones like my phone—it would definitely be my pair of noise-cancelling earphones. I've had this particular set for about two years now, and even though they're starting to look a bit worn out, they are still my most prized possession.

I use them for a variety of purposes throughout the day. During my commute on the subway here in Boston, they are a lifesaver for blocking out the screeching of the trains and the loud chatter of other passengers. When I'm at the lab doing my research on EEG analysis, I put them on to create a "focus bubble," usually listening to some lo-fi beats or white noise. It helps me concentrate on complex data without being distracted by the hum of the equipment or people walking by.

The reason I'm so attached to them is that they've become essential for my mental well-being in a busy city. I'm someone who values peace and quiet, and these earphones allow me to control my environment wherever I go. I remember one time I accidentally left them at home, and I felt incredibly anxious and "exposed" the whole day. It was quite a struggle to get any work done. In addition, they've been a great tool for my language learning, as I use them to listen to English podcasts every day. Without them, my daily routine would feel much more chaotic and far less productive.

# Q25-1:
Describe a lesson that you remember well.
You should say:
- What the lesson was about
- When and where this lesson took place
- What happened during this lesson
And explain why you remember this lesson so well.

# A25-1:
I'd like to describe a very memorable lesson I had during a trip to Tokyo with my friend YiLin last year. It wasn't a traditional academic class, but rather a hands-on cake-making workshop at a small, cozy studio in a quiet neighborhood. We decided to join it on a whim because we wanted to try something different from the usual sightseeing.

The lesson was all about the art of making a traditional Japanese strawberry shortcake. The instructor was a very patient lady who spoke a bit of English, which was helpful. During the two-hour session, she taught us everything from how to whisk the egg whites to the perfect consistency, to the delicate technique of spreading the cream evenly over the sponge. We were each given our own station and ingredients, and it was surprisingly challenging to get the decorations just right.

I remember this lesson so well because it was such a refreshing change of pace from my usual high-pressure research work. It was incredibly satisfying to create something beautiful and delicious with my own hands. Moreover, the atmosphere in the studio was so peaceful and focused. Although my cake didn't look quite as professional as the instructor's, the sense of accomplishment I felt when we finally tasted our creations was wonderful. It taught me the importance of slowing down and enjoying the process of learning a new craft, and it remains one of the absolute highlights of my entire trip to Japan.

# Q26-1:
Describe someone who lives in your area who often helps other people.
You should say:
- Who this person is
- How this person helps others
- How important the help is
And explain why you think this person often helps other people.

# A26-1:
I'd like to talk about an elderly lady who lives just a few doors down from my family home in Taiwan. Everyone in the neighborhood calls her "阿罵," which is a respectful way to say "grandma" in Taiwanese. She's a well-known figure in our small fishing village of Mito.

She has a very unique and heart-warming way of helping the community. Every day, she goes around and collects old books and magazines from the recycling bins. Instead of just selling them for scrap, she spends hours sorting them out, cleaning them, and then she gives them away to the local children who might not have many books at home. She even sets up a little "free library" on a bench outside her house.

I believe her help is incredibly important, especially for the younger generation in our village. By providing these books, she's encouraging kids to read and learn, which is a wonderful gift. Moreover, she's a fantastic storyteller; whenever kids come by to pick up a book, she often shares vivid stories about the history of our village, which helps keep our local culture alive.

I think she does this because she genuinely cares about the people around her and wants to stay active. Although all her children live in the United States and she could easily move there, she chooses to stay because she loves the sense of community. She once told me that helping others makes her feel useful and connected, and I think that's a truly beautiful outlook on life.

# Q27-1:
Describe a popular person you know.
You should say:
- How you knew this person
- Where and when you usually see this person
- What type of person he/she is
And explain why you think this person is very popular.

# A27-1:
The most popular person I can think of in my local community is an elderly neighbor of mine back in Taiwan, whom we all affectionately call "阿罵." I've known her since I was a little kid growing up in the fishing village of Mito. She's lived there for decades, so she's practically a local legend.

I usually see her in the late afternoons when I'm back home for the holidays. She's almost always sitting on a wooden chair outside her house or chatting with people at the local market. She's the kind of person who knows everyone's name and always has a kind word or a funny story to share. She's incredibly warm, energetic, and has a very sharp wit for someone her age.

I think she's so popular because she's the "heart" of our neighborhood. She has this amazing ability to bring people together. For instance, she organizes small gatherings where neighbors can share food and catch up. Furthermore, her hobby of collecting and giving away books to local children has earned her a lot of respect from the parents. People naturally gravitate towards her because she's a great listener and a wonderful storyteller. Even though she lives alone, she's never lonely because there's always a stream of people stopping by to say hello. Her genuine kindness and her positive energy are truly infectious, which is why I believe she's loved by everyone in the village.

# Q28-1:
Describe a happy experience you remember very well from your childhood.
You should say:
- How old you were at that time
- Who you were with
- What happened at the time
And explain why you remember this happy experience.

# A28-1:
One of the happiest memories from my childhood was when I was about eight years old, living in the small fishing village of Mito in Kaohsiung. I remember it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and I was spending time with my father in our backyard.

That day, my dad decided to teach me how to make a traditional rubber band gun. We spent a couple of hours together, carefully cutting pieces of scrap wood and assembling them with small nails. He was very patient, showing me how to create the trigger mechanism using just a simple notch and a sturdy rubber band. Once we finished, I felt like I had the coolest toy in the world. Later that day, I ran out to meet my friends in the neighborhood, and we had a huge "battle" in the alleys, running around and laughing until the sun went down.

I remember this experience so vividly because it was a rare moment of pure, simple joy. It wasn't about having an expensive gadget; it was about the pride of creating something with my own hands and the quality time I spent with my father. Moreover, the feeling of freedom as I played with my friends in the village is something I often look back on with great fondness. Even now, when I'm busy with my research in Boston, thinking about that carefree afternoon always brings a smile to my face and reminds me of the simple pleasures of my upbringing.

# Q29-1:
Describe a game you enjoyed playing when you were younger.
You should say:
- What it was
- Where you played it
- Who you played this game with
And explain why you enjoyed playing this game.

# A29-1:
A game that I've always enjoyed, and still do to some extent, is playing party games on the Nintendo Switch. Although I got the console a few years ago, it reminds me of the fun I had playing simpler games when I was even younger. I usually play it at home, especially during big family gatherings like the Chinese New Year.

During the holidays, I always bring my Switch to my relatives' house. I play with my younger cousins and nephews, and sometimes even the older adults join in. We usually play games that are easy to pick up, like "Mario Kart" or "Overcooked," which require a lot of teamwork and communication. The living room becomes quite chaotic with everyone shouting instructions and cheering each other on.

I enjoyed playing these games because they are a fantastic ice-breaker. In a large family, it can sometimes be hard to find common ground between different generations, but these games provide a shared experience that everyone can enjoy. Furthermore, I love the social aspect of it; it's not just about winning or losing, but about the laughter and the bonding that happens during the process. I also felt a great sense of accomplishment when I once managed to fix a drifting controller by following a YouTube tutorial, which allowed us to keep the game going. Overall, it's the sense of connection and the pure fun that makes these gaming sessions so memorable for me.

# Q30-1:
Describe a car journey you made that you remember well.
You should say:
- When it was
- Who was with you
- How long the journey took
And explain why you remember this car journey so well.

# A30-1:
I'd like to talk about a road trip I took last summer that I remember very clearly. My friends and I decided to drive from Kaohsiung down to Kenting, which is a famous coastal area in southern Taiwan. There were four of us in the car, including my close friend YiLin.

The journey took about three hours, which might not seem very long, but it was packed with great moments. We started early in the morning to avoid the heat, and as we drove further south, the scenery changed from urban landscapes to beautiful coastal views. We spent the whole time chatting, listening to our favorite anime soundtracks, and stopping at small roadside stalls to grab local snacks like grilled squid.

I remember this journey so well because of the sense of anticipation we all felt. We were heading to Kenting specifically to try scuba diving for the first time, which was something we'd been planning for months. The atmosphere in the car was electric with excitement and a bit of nervous energy. Moreover, it was a great chance for us to catch up and bond away from our usual busy lives. When we finally saw the turquoise ocean as we approached our destination, the feeling was absolutely breathtaking. That car ride was the perfect start to an unforgettable weekend of adventure and exploration under the sea.

# Q31-1:
Describe a time when you had to make an important decision.
You should say:
- What decision you had to make
- How you made the decision
- Why this decision was important
And explain whether you think it was a right decision.

# A31-1:
I'd like to describe a decision I had to make last year while I was attending a major anime convention in Taipei. The decision was whether or not to spend a significant portion of my savings on a VIP early-bird pass for the event. It was quite expensive, costing several times more than a standard ticket.

To make the decision, I spent a few days weighing the pros and cons. I talked it over with my friend YiLin, who is also a big fan. I looked at the list of exclusive benefits, such as getting into the venue an hour before the general public and having guaranteed access to certain limited-edition merchandise booths. I also had to look at my budget to see if I could actually afford it without compromising my other expenses.

This decision was important to me because I had been looking forward to this specific convention for a long time. I knew that the items I wanted to buy would sell out almost instantly once the doors opened to everyone. Furthermore, as someone who usually wears noise-cancelling earphones to avoid crowds, having that extra hour of relative quiet was a huge draw.

In the end, I decided to go for it, and I definitely think it was the right decision. Because I got in early, I managed to grab a rare figure for my collection and a special gift for YiLin. The experience was much more relaxed and enjoyable than it would have been otherwise. Although it was a bit of a splurge, the memories and the items I got made it totally worth the investment.

# Q32-1:
Describe an occasion when you got some incorrect information.
You should say:
- When it was
- Where you got the information
- How you found out that the information was not correct
And explain what happened when you found out that the information was not correct.

# A32-1:
I remember a time last year when I got some wrong information that nearly ruined my plans for a big anime convention. I had seen a post on a social media fan group stating that the ticket release would happen on a Friday at noon. I was so sure of this that I even set a reminder on my phone.

However, on the Wednesday before that, I happened to be chatting with my friend YiLin, and he mentioned that he had already secured his tickets. I was completely shocked and confused. I quickly went to the official website of the convention and realized that the information I had seen on social media was outdated or simply incorrect; the tickets had actually gone on sale on Tuesday morning.

When I found out, I felt a huge surge of panic. I thought I had missed my chance to go entirely, as these events usually sell out in minutes. I immediately logged onto the booking site with my heart racing. Luckily, there were still a few standard tickets left, although the VIP passes I had originally wanted were long gone. I managed to grab one just in time.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson about verifying information from official sources, especially for things that are important to me. Although I was frustrated that I missed out on the early-bird perks, I was just relieved that I could still attend the event with my friends. It was a stressful afternoon, but it certainly made me much more careful about where I get my news from in the future.

# Q33-1:
Describe an expensive gift you would like to give to someone.
You should say:
- What gift you would like to buy
- Who you would like to give it to
- How long it would take to save the money
And explain why you would like to give this expensive gift to this person.

# A33-1:
If I had the opportunity, I would love to buy a high-quality PUMA winter jacket for my younger cousin. He's currently a high school student back in Taiwan, and he's always been a big fan of sporty, casual fashion. I remember how much I wanted a similar jacket when I was his age, so I know exactly how much it would mean to him.

Since I'm currently working as a researcher, it wouldn't take me too long to save up the money—perhaps just a month or two of setting aside a portion of my allowance. However, for a student, the price of such a brand-name item is quite significant. I remember when I was in high school, I had to save up for months just to buy my first PUMA item, so I really understand the value of it.

I want to give him this gift because he's been working incredibly hard on his studies lately, and I'd like to reward his efforts. Moreover, I have a funny memory of wearing a similar jacket on my first day of school and bumping into a classmate with the exact same one. I think it's a classic, stylish piece that he could wear for years. Giving him something that is both practical and fashionable would be a great way to show my support for him. Although it's a bit of an expensive splurge, seeing him wear it with pride would be a very rewarding experience for me.

# Q34-1:
Describe a piece of clothing that you enjoy wearing most.
You should say:
- What it looks like
- How often you wear it
- When and where you got it
And explain why you enjoy wearing this piece of clothing so much.

# A34-1:
The piece of clothing I enjoy wearing the most is a classic PUMA zip-up jacket that I've had since my high school days. It's a deep navy blue color with the iconic white logo on the chest and white stripes running down the sleeves. It has a very sporty yet casual look that never really goes out of style.

I wear it surprisingly often, especially during the transitional seasons like spring and autumn. Even now that I'm living in Boston, it's my go-to choice for a quick trip to the grocery store or a casual walk in the park. It's incredibly comfortable and fits me perfectly, even after all these years.

I actually got this jacket back in Taiwan after saving up my allowance for several months. I remember being so proud when I finally walked into the store and bought it with my own money. There's also a funny story attached to it; on the first day I wore it to school, I ran into a classmate who was wearing the exact same jacket. We both just stood there and laughed about it.

I enjoy wearing it so much because it's more than just a garment to me; it's full of memories. It reminds me of my teenage years and the satisfaction of working towards a goal. Furthermore, it's very practical and versatile. Whether I'm pairing it with jeans or gym gear, it always feels right. Even though I have newer and more expensive clothes, this jacket remains my absolute favorite because of the history and the comfort it provides.

# Q35-1:
Describe an exciting adventure you would like to go on.
You should say:
- Who you would go with
- Where you would go
- What you would do on the adventure
And explain why you would like to go on this adventure.

# A35-1:
I'd like to talk about a scuba diving adventure I've been dreaming of. Although I've had a beginner experience before, I really want to go on a proper diving expedition to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. I'd definitely go with my close group of friends from Taiwan because we've shared many road trips together, including a three-hour drive down to Kenting last year for our first dive.

On this adventure, we would spend several days on a boat, exploring different dive sites. The main activity would be descending into the deep blue to witness the world-famous coral reefs. I'm particularly excited about seeing the diverse marine life, like sea turtles and colorful tropical fish, in their natural habitat. It's a completely different world underwater where everything feels incredibly peaceful and breathtaking.

The reason I'm so keen on this adventure is that my interest was first sparked by a diving documentary. Even though that film was a bit disappointing because it focused too much on technical details, it made me curious enough to try it myself. After that first taste in Kenting, I became hooked. I now spend time watching professional diving competitions online, which further fuels my desire to explore the ocean. To me, the ultimate adventure is having the ocean as your office, even if just for a week, and experiencing the thrill of the unknown beneath the waves.

# Q36-1:
Describe a water sport you would like to try in the future.
You should say:
- What it is
- Where you would try it
- Whether it is easy or difficult to do
And explain why you would like to try this water sport.

# A36-1:
A water sport that I'm absolutely fascinated by and would love to try properly in the future is scuba diving. I've always been drawn to the ocean, perhaps because I grew up in Mito, a small fishing village in Kaohsiung. I'd love to head back to Kenting, which is at the southern tip of Taiwan, to complete a full certification course.

In terms of difficulty, I wouldn't say it's easy. It requires a lot of technical knowledge about equipment and safety procedures. When I tried a beginner session last year, I realized that controlling your buoyancy and breathing underwater takes a lot of practice and calm. However, once you get the hang of it, the effort is completely worth it. You feel weightless, almost like you're flying through a silent, liquid world.

I'm eager to try this because I've always wanted to see the breathtaking coral reefs firsthand. My curiosity actually started with a Netflix documentary about diving. Although the film itself was slightly disappointing as it was quite dry and technical, the glimpses of the underwater scenery were enough to captivate me. Since then, I've even started watching professional diving competitions. I think the idea of exploring a part of our planet that most people never see is incredibly exciting. It's a way to escape the noise of daily life and find total peace.

# Q37-1:
Describe a traditional celebration you enjoy in your country.
You should say:
- What it is
- Who you celebrate with
- What you do in this celebration
And explain why you enjoy this traditional celebration.

# A37-1:
In Taiwan, the most significant traditional celebration is undoubtedly the Lunar New Year, and it's the one I enjoy the most. It's a time when the entire family gathers together, regardless of how far away everyone lives. I usually celebrate it with my parents, cousins, and nephews in our hometown.

The celebration involves a lot of traditional customs, like having a massive reunion dinner and giving out red envelopes. However, in recent years, we've added a modern twist to our festivities. I always bring my Nintendo Switch, and we spend hours playing party games together. It has become a bit of a new tradition for us. We set it up on the big TV in the living room, and I play with my younger cousins while the older relatives watch and cheer us on. It's a fantastic ice-breaker that bridges the generation gap.

I truly enjoy this celebration because it's one of the few times in the year when I can completely unwind and bond with my relatives. Even though I'm often busy with my research or work, this holiday allows me to reconnect with my roots. Playing games on the Switch adds a layer of laughter and friendly competition to the traditional atmosphere. I remember one time the controller started drifting, and I even had to fix it myself using a YouTube tutorial just so we could keep playing. Those little moments of shared joy and problem-solving make the holiday feel very special and memorable.

# Q38-1:
Describe a time when you spent some time with a child.
You should say:
- Who the child was
- Why you spent time with this child
- When it was
And explain how you felt about spending time with this child.

# A38-1:
I'd like to talk about a time I spent an afternoon playing with my younger cousin, who is about seven years old. This happened during the last Lunar New Year holiday when my whole family gathered in Kaohsiung. Since I'm one of the older cousins, I often end up looking after the younger ones while the adults are busy preparing the big reunion dinner or chatting.

To keep him entertained, I brought out my Nintendo Switch. We spent a couple of hours playing various party games like Mario Kart and some sports simulations. It was actually quite funny because he was surprisingly good at it, and he was so enthusiastic every time he won a race. Even some of my older relatives, like my aunts and uncles, stopped what they were doing to watch us play and cheer him on. It turned into a lively little event in the middle of our living room.

I felt really happy and relaxed during that time. Usually, my life is quite intense with my research on EEG analysis and quantum machine learning, so playing simple games with a child was a great way to switch off my brain. It was heartwarming to see how much joy a simple game could bring him. Moreover, it made me realize how technology like the Switch can act as a bridge between different generations. Even though there's a big age gap between us, we were able to connect and have a great laugh together, which made the holiday feel much more meaningful.

# Q39-1:
Describe a book you have read more than once.
You should say:
- Why you read this book
- What this book was about
- Whether you learnt anything from it
And explain why you have read this book more than once.

# A39-1:
There is a specific deep learning textbook that I have returned to at least three or four times over the past few years. I first picked it up during my master's degree at National Taiwan University because it was highly recommended by my professors for understanding the foundations of artificial intelligence.

The book is quite dense and covers the mathematical theories behind neural networks and machine learning algorithms. When I first read it, I'll be honest, I barely understood half of the concepts. The math felt incredibly abstract and overwhelming at the time. However, I kept it on my shelf as a reference. A few years later, when I moved to Boston to conduct research at Harvard, I opened it again. Suddenly, because I was working on actual EEG analysis and quantum machine learning projects, the theories started to click.

I've learned that a good technical book grows with you. Every time I re-read a chapter, I notice a detail or a footnote that I completely missed before. I've read it multiple times because my own level of experience has changed, which allows me to interpret the information in new ways. It's no longer just a collection of formulas; it's a practical guide that helps me solve real-world problems in my research. This process of revisiting the text has taught me that mastery isn't about reading something once, but about deepening your understanding through repeated exposure and practical application.

# Q40-1:
Describe an invention which is very useful in your daily life.
You should say:
- What it is
- What you use it for
- Whether it is easy to use
And explain why it is very useful in your daily life.

# A40-1:
If I had to choose one invention that has significantly improved my quality of life, it would definitely be noise-cancelling earphones. I've had my current pair for about two years, and I use them almost every single day. Whether I'm commuting on the subway, working in a busy coffee shop, or just walking through the crowded streets of Boston, they are always with me.

In terms of usability, they are incredibly simple to operate. With just a single tap, I can switch between noise-cancelling mode and transparency mode. I mainly use them to create a "personal bubble" of silence, which helps me focus on my research papers or listen to English podcasts to improve my language skills. When I'm deep into analyzing EEG data or quantum ML models, any background noise can be quite distracting, so these earphones are a lifesaver.

They are useful because they give me control over my environment. In today's world, it's often hard to find a truly quiet space, especially in a big city. These earphones allow me to turn a noisy commute into a productive study session or a relaxing break. I remember one time I forgot them at home and I felt quite uncomfortable and exposed to the city's din all day. It made me realize just how much I rely on this clever piece of technology to maintain my focus and mental well-being throughout my daily routine.

# Q41-1:
Describe a place which is far away that you would like to visit in the future.
You should say:
- Where it is
- How you would travel there
- What you would do there
And explain why you would really like to visit this place.

# A41-1:
A place that is quite far from where I am now but that I'm desperate to visit is Japan, specifically the city of Kyoto. Since I'm currently based in Boston for my research, it would involve a very long flight across the Pacific, likely with a layover in San Francisco or perhaps back in my home country, Taiwan.

Once I arrive, I plan to spend my time exploring the ancient temples and traditional gardens that Kyoto is famous for. I've always been fascinated by Japanese culture, partly because I followed a Japanese YouTuber for years to help me practice the language. I'd love to try the local street food, visit the Fushimi Inari Shrine, and perhaps even take a traditional craft workshop. I previously went to Tokyo with my friend YiLin, and although we had an amazing time, we got so lost in Shinjuku Station that we didn't get to see as much of the traditional side as I wanted.

I really want to visit Kyoto because I'm looking for a contrast to my busy academic life. My work involves a lot of high-tech research into quantum machine learning, so the idea of walking through peaceful, centuries-old Zen gardens is incredibly appealing. I want to experience that sense of history and tranquility firsthand. Moreover, after my previous trip to Japan, I've felt a strong connection to the lifestyle there, and I'd love to see if Kyoto feels as magical as it looks in the videos I've watched.

# Q42-1:
Describe a time when you lost your way.
You should say:
- When it was
- Where you went
- How you got lost
And explain what happened after you lost your way.

# A42-1:
I remember a time I got completely lost during a five-day trip to Tokyo with my friend YiLin. It happened on our second day when we decided to explore Shinjuku, which is one of the busiest districts in the world. We were trying to find a specific department store, but we ended up inside Shinjuku Station, which is notorious for being a massive, underground maze.

We got lost because the station has dozens of exits and endless interconnected passages. Even though we were following a travel guide I'd read multiple times, the sheer scale of the place was overwhelming. We kept following signs that seemed to lead to the surface, but we would just end up in another subterranean shopping mall or a different train platform. To make matters worse, the air down there was quite stuffy and crowded, which made us feel even more disoriented and a bit stressed.

Eventually, we decided to stop rushing and just sat down for a moment to check our GPS properly. We realized we had been walking in the wrong direction for about twenty minutes. After we calmed down, we managed to find a map near one of the ticket gates and followed the color-coded lines to the correct exit. Although we were exhausted by the time we finally reached the street, we both just looked at each other and laughed about how we'd been defeated by a train station. It was a memorable experience that taught me to always double-check the exit number before entering a large station in Japan.

# Q43-1:
Describe your idea of a perfect house.
You should say:
- Where it would be
- What it would be like
- How special it would be
And explain why it would be perfect for you.

# A43-1:
My idea of a perfect house would be a simple, modern home located right on the coast of my hometown, Mito, in Kaohsiung. Mito is a small fishing village, and I grew up taking long walks along the shore there. Having a house in that specific location would mean I could see the ocean every single day.

The house itself would have large, floor-to-ceiling windows to let in plenty of natural light and provide an unobstructed view of the sunset. I'd want a minimalist interior design with a dedicated space for my research and a cozy corner for my Nintendo Switch. It wouldn't need to be huge, but it would need to feel open and airy, filled with the sound of the waves and the smell of the sea air.

What would make this house so special is the emotional connection to my childhood. I have such vivid memories of walking along the fishing harbour with my family, watching the orange and red sky as the sun went down. Living there would feel like coming full circle. It would be perfect for me because it offers a sense of peace and simplicity that is hard to find in big cities like Boston or Taipei. After a long day of working on complex quantum machine learning models, being able to step outside and walk along the familiar coastline would be the ultimate way to recharge and stay connected to my roots.

# Q44-1:
Describe a sport that you enjoy watching.
You should say:
- What it is
- Who you usually watch this sport with

A sport that I've recently become very fond of watching is professional scuba diving competitions. While it might not be as mainstream as football or basketball, it's incredibly captivating. I usually watch these events online, sometimes by myself when I want to relax, or occasionally with my friends who went diving with me in Kenting last year.

I first discovered this sport after that trip to Kenting. We had driven three hours down from Kaohsiung to try a beginner dive, and I was so blown away by the experience that I started searching for more diving content on YouTube. I stumbled upon a live stream of a technical diving competition, and I was immediately hooked. It was fascinating to see how the pros navigate complex underwater environments with such precision and calm.

I enjoy watching it because it reminds me of the breathtaking world beneath the waves. There's a certain elegance to the way the divers move, and the technical aspect of managing their equipment is quite impressive to someone like me who enjoys science and research. Moreover, it serves as a great source of inspiration for my own future adventures. Even though a diving documentary I once watched was a bit disappointing because it was too dry, these live competitions are full of suspense and beauty. It's a way for me to experience the thrill of the ocean from the comfort of my living room.

# Q45-1:
Describe a new shop that has opened in your city.
You should say:
- Where it is
- What it sells
- Who goes shopping there
And explain how successful you think this new shop will be.

# A45-1:
A new shop that recently opened near my apartment is a flagship PUMA store. It's located in a very trendy, high-traffic area that's popular with both locals and tourists. The store is quite large and has a very modern, sleek design that catches your eye as you walk past.

They sell a wide range of sportswear, from high-performance running shoes to casual streetwear. I've noticed that a lot of young people and fitness enthusiasts frequent the shop. It seems to be a popular spot for students and young professionals who are looking for that balance between a sporty and casual style. Every time I pass by, it reminds me of a PUMA jacket I desperately wanted back in high school. I had to save up my allowance for months to afford it, only to find a classmate wearing the exact same one on the first day of school!

I believe this shop will be very successful for several reasons. Firstly, the brand has a strong reputation for quality and style, which appeals to the fashion-conscious demographic in this area. Secondly, the location is perfect for attracting foot traffic. Although many people shop online these days, there's still a strong desire to try on athletic gear in person to ensure the right fit. Given the constant stream of customers I see whenever I walk past, I think it's going to be a major landmark in the neighborhood for a long time.

# Q46-1:
Describe a film you saw recently that you found disappointing.
You should say:
- What kind of film it was
- What it was about
- Why you decided to watch this film
And explain why you found this film disappointing.

# A46-1:
I recently watched a documentary on Netflix about the history of deep-sea exploration and scuba diving. I'm generally a big fan of documentaries, especially those that explore the natural world, so I had fairly high expectations for this one.

The film was supposed to be about the evolution of diving technology and the discovery of hidden underwater ecosystems. I decided to watch it because I've been obsessed with diving ever since my friends and I took a road trip to Kenting to try it ourselves. I was really looking forward to seeing some breathtaking footage of coral reefs and exotic marine life, similar to what I experienced firsthand in the ocean.

However, I found the film quite disappointing because it focused almost entirely on the dry, technical side of the equipment. There were long segments about the physics of gas mixtures and the history of early diving bells, but very little actual underwater cinematography. It felt more like a lecture than a journey of discovery. While I appreciate the science behind it—given my background in research—I was hoping for something more visually inspiring that captured the peace and beauty of being underwater. Instead of feeling excited about my next dive, I just felt a bit bored by the end of it. It really missed the mark in terms of conveying the magic of the ocean.

# Q47-1:
Describe a time when you had to give a talk to lots of people.
You should say:
- Who you gave this talk to
- What the talk was about
- Why you gave this talk
And explain how you felt about giving the talk to lots of people.

# A47-1:
I remember a time I had to give a formal presentation during an academic seminar at Harvard. The audience consisted of about fifty people, including fellow researchers, senior professors, and some graduate students from the computer science department. It was definitely one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life.

The talk was about my recent research into quantum machine learning and its potential applications in EEG analysis. I had to explain some very complex mathematical models and show how they could be used to interpret brain signals more accurately. I gave this talk as part of my research fellowship requirements, as it's important to share our findings with the wider scientific community and get feedback from experts in the field. To prepare, I spent weeks going over my data and even revisited my old deep learning textbooks to make sure my foundational explanations were solid.

At first, I felt incredibly anxious. Standing in front of such a knowledgeable group of people was intimidating, and I was worried about being asked a question I couldn't answer. However, as I started speaking and saw people nodding in interest, I began to feel more confident. By the end of the presentation, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment. It was a great feeling to know that I could communicate my passion for quantum ML to such a high-level audience. Even though it was stressful, it was a vital step in my professional development.

I'd like to talk about my elderly neighbor in Taiwan, whom we affectionately call 阿罵. While she hasn't moved recently, her children all moved into their own homes in the United States several years ago. They originally moved abroad to pursue better career opportunities in the tech and medical fields, which are very competitive.

They now live in typical American suburban houses, which are quite different from the close-knit village atmosphere of Mito where we grew up. These houses are much larger, with private backyards and plenty of space, but they are also quite far from the bustling markets and social hubs that 阿罵 is used to. She often tells me stories about how her kids are doing over there, and although she misses them, she seems proud of what they've achieved.

I think the move was a positive change for them in terms of their professional lives and their children's education. They have access to resources and career paths that might not have been available in a small fishing village. However, I do think there's a downside in terms of family connection. The distance makes it difficult for them to visit often, and I can tell that 阿罵 sometimes feels a bit lonely, even though she stays busy collecting old books for the neighborhood kids. It's a classic trade-off between pursuing a successful career far away and staying close to one's roots and family.

# Q49-1:

Last year, I went to a massive anime convention in Taipei with a group of my closest friends. We had been planning this trip for weeks, even going as far as buying VIP early-bird passes so we could get in before the general public. The event was held in a huge exhibition center, but even so, the place was absolutely packed.

The convention was a celebration of all things related to Japanese animation and gaming. There were hundreds of booths selling limited-edition merchandise, famous voice actors giving talks, and thousands of people dressed up in elaborate cosplay. The reason it was so crowded is that this is the biggest event of its kind in Taiwan, and fans travel from all over the country to grab exclusive figures and meet like-minded people. At one point, we actually got lost in the sea of people while trying to find a specific booth we'd seen on the map.

As someone who usually prefers quiet environments—I'm the type of person who wears noise-cancelling earphones everywhere—I felt a bit overwhelmed by the noise and the constant bumping into people. However, there was also an incredible sense of energy and excitement in the air. It was amazing to see so many people sharing the same passion. Although it was exhausting and I felt a huge sense of relief when we finally stepped outside into the fresh air, I'm glad I went. It was a unique experience that made me feel part of a vibrant community, even if it was a bit too crowded for my daily taste.

# Q50-1:
Describe a job you think would be interesting to do.
You should say:
- What it is
- What skills are necessary to do the job
- When you first knew this job
And explain why you think this job would be interesting to do.

# A50-1:
A job that I think would be incredibly interesting, and quite a departure from my current research, is being a scuba diving instructor. To do this job well, you need a combination of high-level swimming skills, deep technical knowledge of diving equipment, and, most importantly, the ability to stay calm and teach others under pressure. You also need to be very patient and have great communication skills to ensure your students feel safe.

I first seriously considered how interesting this job could be after I went on a diving trip to Kenting last year. We drove down from Kaohsiung to try a beginner session, and our instructor was so passionate and knowledgeable. He made the whole experience feel like an adventure. Since then, I've been watching professional diving competitions and documentaries, which has only increased my respect for the profession.

I think this job would be fascinating because your "office" is literally the ocean. Instead of sitting in a lab analyzing EEG data or quantum machine learning models all day, you'd be exploring breathtaking coral reefs and encountering marine life. There's something very appealing about the idea of helping people discover a completely different world and seeing the look of wonder on their faces when they first breathe underwater. It would be a very active, outdoorsy lifestyle that offers a perfect escape from the stresses of modern city life. Even though it's a lot of responsibility, the rewards of being surrounded by such natural beauty every day would be immense.

# Q51-1:
Describe an interesting neighbor.
You should say:
- What he/she does
- How you met this neighbor
- How often you see this neighbor
And explain why you think this neighbor is interesting.

# A51-1:
I'd like to talk about an elderly lady who lives just a few doors down from my family home in Taiwan. We all call her 阿罵. She has a very unique and heart-warming hobby: she spends her days collecting old books from recycling bins around the neighborhood. She then carefully cleans them, sorts them by genre, and gives them away for free to local children or anyone who might enjoy them.

I first met her years ago when I was just a kid myself. I remember seeing her with a small cart full of books and being curious about what she was doing. Now, whenever I go back to Taiwan to visit my family, I see her almost every day. She's usually out in her front yard or walking around the village, always ready with a smile and a story.

I find her incredibly interesting because of her positive outlook on life. Even though all her children moved to the United States years ago to pursue their careers, she never seems lonely or bitter. Instead, she has dedicated her life to serving her community in her own small way. She's also a fantastic storyteller; every time we chat, she tells me these vivid tales about what our village, Mito, was like decades ago. I always learn something new from her, whether it's a bit of local history or a lesson in resilience. She's a reminder that you don't need a high-tech job or a fancy house to make a real difference in people's lives.
