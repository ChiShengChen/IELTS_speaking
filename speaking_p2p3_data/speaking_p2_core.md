用「動漫展」來示範，同一個故事怎麼換開頭套不同題：

核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
I've been going to anime conventions every year since I was a teenager. Last year, I went to a big one in Taipei with my friends. We spent weeks planning — checking which booths to visit, which limited-edition figures to grab. The venue was absolutely packed, like a sea of people, and we actually got lost trying to find a specific booth. I also made a bold decision to buy a VIP early-bird pass, which was quite expensive, but totally worth it because we got in an hour early and grabbed some exclusive merchandise. One of my friends couldn't make it because he couldn't get time off work, which was a shame.

結尾多講跟題目相關的感受



人 熱心的(人物) 核心故事範例
核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
There's this elderly lady who lives near my home in Taiwan. She has a really interesting hobby — she collects old books from recycling bins, sorts them out, and gives them to people who need them, like kids in the neighbourhood. What I find fascinating about her is that all her children live in the US and rarely come back to visit, but she never seems lonely. She actually loves her life in Taiwan and says she finds it much more fun to hang out with her neighbours than to move abroad. She's also an amazing storyteller — every time I chat with her, she tells me these vivid stories about what the village was like decades ago. I always learn something new from her.

同一個阿罵，六題全部搞定。要繼續看其他故事的範例嗎？



PUMA 核心故事範例
核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
When I was in high school, I really wanted this PUMA jacket that I saw in a store. It was way too expensive for me at the time, so I saved up my allowance for months until I could finally afford it. I was so proud of myself when I bought it. But here's the funny part — on the first day of the new semester, I wore it to school feeling great, and then I bumped into another classmate wearing the exact same jacket. It was such an awkward moment, we just looked at each other and laughed. There's actually a new PUMA store that recently opened near my place, and every time I walk past it, I think about that story. I still love the brand though — I think it's got a good balance between sporty and casual.

給我Switch(遊戲)核心故事範例
核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
I got my Nintendo Switch a few years ago, and it's honestly one of the best things I've ever bought. I play it mostly on weekends to unwind after a long week. But the best part is during Chinese New Year — when the whole family gets together, I bring out the Switch and play party games with my younger cousins and nephews. It's a great ice-breaker, even the older relatives end up watching and cheering. One time, the joystick started drifting really badly, and instead of sending it in for repair, I watched a YouTube tutorial and fixed it myself with a small screwdriver kit. It took me about an hour, but I managed to get it working again. I felt pretty accomplished after that. I think the Switch is one of the most clever inventions in gaming — you can play it on the TV at home or just take it with you anywhere. I honestly can't imagine not having it.

一台 Switch，六題全搞定。要繼續看其他故事嗎？





日本旅遊(旅行) 核心故事範例


核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
I went on a five-day trip to Tokyo with my friend YiLin. The whole thing started because I'd been following this Japanese YouTuber for a while to practice my Japanese, and his videos made me really want to visit Tokyo. We had an amazing time — we tried street food, visited temples, and explored different neighbourhoods. But the most memorable part was probably Shinjuku. We got completely lost in the station — it was like a maze with endless exits and underground passages. And honestly, the air around that area was not great, kind of stuffy and smelly because of all the crowds and traffic. But it wasn't all bad — we also did a hands-on cake-making class at this little studio, which was one of the highlights. Before the trip, I kept reading this Tokyo travel guide over and over to plan our route. Now I try to travel abroad at least once a year. The trip actually made me think about maybe living in Japan someday — the lifestyle really appeals to me.

一趟日本旅行，十題全搞定。要看潛水的嗎？


潛水核心故事範例
核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
Scuba diving is something I've always wanted to try. I first got interested after watching a diving documentary, but honestly it was a bit disappointing — it focused too much on the technical side and not enough on the actual underwater scenery. Still, it made me curious enough to look into it more. Last year, my friends and I drove about three hours down to Kenting to try a beginner diving experience. Being underwater was a completely different world — the coral reefs were breathtaking and everything was so peaceful. After that trip, I started watching professional diving competitions online, which is surprisingly exciting. I even thought about how cool it would be to become a diving instructor someday — imagine your office being the ocean. It's definitely something I want to do more of.

抽到「Describe a job you'd be interested in」：
"I'd like to talk about being a scuba diving instructor. I got interested after trying diving in Kenting — imagine having the ocean as your office every day..." → 多講這工作吸引你什麼、跟你現在的工作差多大、為什麼嚮往

一個潛水經歷，五題全搞定。


核心故事（你只要記這一段）：
One of my favourite walks growing up was along the coast near my hometown, Mito. It's a small fishing village in Kaohsiung, and there's this path that stretches from the village all the way to a nearby fishing harbour. It takes about an hour or so on foot. I used to walk it with my family when I was younger, usually in the late afternoon. The best part was the sunset — the sky would turn orange and red over the ocean, and you could hear nothing but the waves and seagulls. Along the way, you'd pass fishing boats lined up on the shore, and sometimes you'd see locals drying fish on racks by the road. The whole place smelled like the sea. It was so peaceful and simple. Now that I live in Boston, I really miss that walk. Every time I go back to Taiwan, I try to do it at least once. It reminds me of how I grew up and how different life is in a small village compared to a big city.

一條海邊小路，五題都能用。要我繼續生成耳機和教科書的核心故事嗎？



A24 離不開的東西 — 耳機 核心故事：
If I had to pick one thing I can't live without — other than my phone or computer — it would be my noise-cancelling earphones. I wear them pretty much everywhere. On the subway, in coffee shops, even just walking around. They're like my personal bubble. When I'm working, I put on white noise or lo-fi music to help me focus. During my commute, I listen to English podcasts, which actually helps a lot with my listening skills. And in crowded places, they're a lifesaver — I just put them on and suddenly everything feels calmer. I remember one time I forgot them at home and I felt uncomfortable the whole day, like something was missing. It sounds dramatic, but they really change how I experience my daily routine. I've had this pair for about two years now, and even though they're a bit scratched up, I can't imagine replacing them.

B14 多次閱讀的書 — 教科書 核心故事：
There's this deep learning textbook that I've read at least three or four times over the years. The first time I picked it up was during my master's at NTU. To be honest, I barely understood half of it — the math was really dense and a lot of the concepts felt abstract. But I kept it on my shelf. A couple of years later, when I started doing research at Harvard, I picked it up again, and suddenly things clicked. I could relate the theories to my actual work on EEG analysis and quantum machine learning. It was like reading a completely different book. I've gone back to it a few more times since then, and every time I notice something new — a formula I'd skipped before, or a footnote that suddenly makes sense. I think that's the beauty of a really good technical book — it grows with you. Your understanding deepens as your experience grows, so the same words mean something different each time.
