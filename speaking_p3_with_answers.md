# Q1-1:
What are the main reasons why people choose to follow celebrities or influencers on social media?

# A1-1:
I think there are several key reasons why people are drawn to influencers. Primarily, it's about seeking inspiration or entertainment that feels more relatable than traditional media. Many followers look for lifestyle tips, fashion advice, or even just a sense of connection with someone they admire. Moreover, social media creates an illusion of intimacy, making fans feel like they're part of the influencer's daily life. For instance, I started following a Japanese YouTuber after my trip to Tokyo because her videos provided a unique perspective on local culture that I couldn't find in guidebooks. Ultimately, these digital personalities offer a mix of escapism and practical information that keeps audiences engaged.

# Q1-2:
How has the way people consume news and entertainment changed since the rise of social media platforms?

# A1-2:
The shift has been quite dramatic, moving from scheduled broadcasts to on-demand, bite-sized content. Nowadays, people often get their news from Twitter or Facebook feeds rather than waiting for the evening news. This means information travels much faster, although it also increases the risk of encountering misinformation. In terms of entertainment, the focus has shifted toward personalized algorithms that suggest content based on individual preferences. I've noticed this in my own life, as I now primarily use Twitter to stay updated on AI news and quantum research. Consequently, the traditional role of editors and curators has been largely replaced by automated systems and social sharing.

# Q1-3:
To what extent do you agree that social media influencers have a negative impact on the self-esteem of young people?

# A1-3:
While influencers can provide positive role models, I believe they often contribute to unrealistic expectations that can harm self-esteem. Many young people constantly compare their own lives to the highly curated and filtered images they see online. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or a "fear of missing out." However, it's also true that some influencers promote body positivity and mental health awareness, which can have the opposite effect. From my perspective, the impact depends heavily on the type of content being consumed. While some platforms can be toxic, others offer supportive communities for niche interests, much like the online groups I joined to learn about mobile payments.

# Q2-1:
What types of jobs do people in your country generally consider to be the most beneficial to society?

# A2-1:
In my country, professions that involve direct service to the community, such as healthcare and education, are typically held in the highest regard. Doctors and nurses are seen as essential because they save lives, while teachers are valued for shaping the minds of the next generation. People also deeply respect those who work in public safety or environmental protection. For example, I've always admired my former science teacher who spent his Wednesdays conducting extra experiments to spark our curiosity. These roles are considered beneficial because their primary goal is the well-being of others rather than just generating profit, which creates a strong sense of social cohesion.

# Q2-2:
How do the social contributions of public sector workers compare to those working in the private sector?

# A2-2:
Public sector workers generally focus on providing universal services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are fundamental to a functioning society. Their contribution is often measured by the stability and equity they provide to all citizens. On the other hand, the private sector drives innovation and economic growth, creating jobs and developing new technologies that improve our quality of life. While public workers ensure that basic needs are met, private companies often push the boundaries of what's possible. I think both are necessary; for instance, while government researchers provide foundational data, private labs might turn that into a practical tool like the noise-cancelling earphones I use daily.

# Q2-3:
Do you think that the most useful jobs in society will be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future?

# A2-3:
I don't believe that the most essential roles will be entirely replaced, although they will certainly be transformed. Jobs that require high levels of empathy, ethical judgment, and complex problem-solving, such as nursing or teaching, are difficult for AI to replicate. While AI can handle data-heavy tasks or routine diagnostics, the human element remains crucial for providing emotional support and nuanced guidance. In my own research into quantum machine learning at Harvard, I've seen how AI can be a powerful tool, but it still requires human oversight to interpret results meaningfully. Therefore, instead of replacement, we're more likely to see a collaboration where AI handles the mundane aspects of these vital jobs.

# Q3-1:
Why do some stories remain popular in a culture for hundreds of years while others are quickly forgotten?

# A3-1:
Enduring stories usually touch upon universal human experiences and emotions, such as love, loss, or the struggle between good and evil. These themes remain relevant regardless of how much society changes technologically or socially. Moreover, stories that are deeply embedded in a culture's identity or folklore tend to be passed down through generations, gaining a sense of timelessness. My neighbor, an elderly lady I call Grandma, often tells stories about our local history that have been preserved for decades because they resonate with our community's values. In contrast, stories that rely on fleeting trends or lack emotional depth are often forgotten once the initial novelty wears off.

# Q3-2:
In what ways does the medium of a story, such as a book or a film, affect how an audience perceives its message?

# A3-2:
The medium significantly shapes the audience's engagement and interpretation. A book allows for deep internal monologues and requires the reader to use their imagination, which often leads to a more personal and reflective experience. For example, I read a deep learning textbook four times to truly grasp its complex concepts, something a quick video couldn't achieve. Conversely, a film uses visual and auditory cues to create an immediate emotional impact and can reach a much wider audience quickly. While a film might simplify a message for the sake of pacing, it can also make a story feel more vivid and accessible through powerful cinematography and performances.

# Q3-3:
How important is it for parents to continue the tradition of telling oral stories to their children in the digital age?

# A3-3:
I believe it's incredibly important because oral storytelling fosters a unique bond between parent and child that digital media cannot replicate. It encourages active listening and allows parents to tailor the story to their child's specific needs or questions. Furthermore, it helps preserve family history and cultural heritage in a way that feels personal and authentic. My friend YiLin and I often talk about the stories our parents told us, which helped shape our values and imagination. While tablets and videos are convenient, they are passive experiences. Oral stories, however, are interactive and help develop a child's language skills and emotional intelligence through direct human interaction.

# Q4-1:
What are the most common topics that people in your country like to discuss when they meet with friends?

# A4-1:
Commonly, people enjoy discussing their daily lives, work challenges, and shared hobbies. In a fast-paced society, catching up on personal news is a way to maintain social bonds and offer mutual support. Additionally, popular culture, such as the latest movies, TV shows, or even viral social media trends, often serves as a frequent conversation starter. When I meet up with my friend YiLin, we usually spend hours talking about our recent travels or upcoming projects. Food is another major topic, as people love sharing recommendations for new restaurants or discussing traditional recipes. These discussions help people feel connected and provide a much-needed break from their professional responsibilities.

# Q4-2:
How has the nature of public discussion changed with the increasing use of online forums and message boards?

# A4-2:
Public discussion has become much more democratic but also more fragmented. Online forums allow people from all over the world to connect over niche interests, which wasn't possible in the past. For instance, I've participated in intense discussions at anime conventions in Taipei where fans gather to debate plot points. However, the anonymity of the internet can sometimes lead to more aggressive or polarized debates compared to face-to-face conversations. Moreover, the sheer volume of information can make it difficult to find consensus, as people often retreat into "echo chambers" where they only hear viewpoints that align with their own. This has made public discourse faster and more diverse, yet arguably more contentious.

# Q4-3:
To what extent is it possible for people with completely different viewpoints to have a productive and peaceful discussion?

# A4-3:
I believe it's entirely possible, provided there is a foundation of mutual respect and a genuine willingness to listen. Productive discussions occur when participants focus on understanding the other person's perspective rather than simply trying to "win" the argument. By identifying common ground or shared goals, people can bridge even significant ideological gaps. In my academic presentations at Harvard, I often had to engage with researchers who held very different theories, yet we could still have constructive dialogues by focusing on the data. While it requires patience and emotional maturity, such discussions are essential for social progress and for finding creative solutions to complex problems that affect everyone.

# Q5-1:
How important is it for individuals to have a diverse circle of friends rather than just one close companion?

# A5-1:
Having a diverse circle of friends is vital because it exposes an individual to a wide range of perspectives and life experiences. This diversity can challenge one's own biases and foster a more inclusive worldview. While a single close companion provides deep emotional security, a broader group offers different types of support and knowledge. For example, while I cherish my close friendship with YiLin, I also value the insights I gain from my colleagues in the quantum research field. A variety of friends can introduce you to new hobbies, cultures, and ways of thinking, which ultimately leads to greater personal growth and a more resilient social support system.

# Q5-2:
What role does shared interest play in maintaining long-term relationships between people?

# A5-2:
Shared interests often act as the "glue" that holds a relationship together over time, especially when life gets busy. They provide a natural reason to meet up and a consistent source of conversation and enjoyment. Whether it's a passion for hiking, cooking, or a specific genre of music, these commonalities create shared memories and a sense of belonging. I've found that my interest in baking has helped me stay connected with friends as we often try out new recipes together. However, while shared interests are a great starting point, long-term relationships also require deeper values like trust and loyalty to survive the inevitable changes that occur as people grow older.

# Q5-3:
Do you think that the way people spend their leisure time with others will change significantly in the next few decades?

# A5-3:
I suspect we will see a significant shift toward more virtual and technology-mediated social experiences. With the advancement of virtual reality and high-speed internet, people might "hang out" in digital spaces that feel increasingly realistic. This could be particularly useful for maintaining long-distance friendships or for those with limited mobility. Nevertheless, I believe the fundamental human need for physical presence and face-to-face interaction will remain. Even though I enjoy playing Switch games with my family during the Lunar New Year, the most meaningful part is the actual physical gathering and the laughter we share in person. So, while the tools will change, the core desire for genuine connection will likely persist.

# Q6-1:
What qualities do people usually look for when they are deciding whether to start a new friendship?

# A6-1:
Most people look for qualities like honesty, reliability, and a similar sense of humor. A good friend is typically someone you can trust with your thoughts and who will be there for you during difficult times. Additionally, having shared values or a similar outlook on life can make the connection feel more natural and effortless. For instance, I was drawn to my neighbor, the elderly book collector, because of her kindness and her fascinating stories about the past. While initial attraction might be based on common hobbies, the decision to deepen a friendship usually depends on whether the other person demonstrates genuine care and respect for your well-being.

# Q6-2:
How does the process of getting to know someone differ in a professional environment compared to a social one?

# A6-2:
In a professional setting, the process is usually more structured and focused on competence and reliability. You get to know someone through their work ethic, communication style, and how they handle pressure. The boundaries are more clearly defined, and personal details are often shared more gradually. In contrast, social environments are more relaxed and allow for a quicker exchange of personal stories and emotions. When I was doing research at Harvard, I got to know my peers through our shared academic goals, whereas with my friend YiLin, our bond was built on shared travels and personal experiences. Social connections tend to be more spontaneous, while professional ones are built on mutual respect for each other's expertise.

# Q6-3:
To what degree has technology made it easier or more difficult for people to form genuine connections with strangers?

# A6-3:
Technology is a double-edged sword in this regard. On one hand, it has made it incredibly easy to find and talk to people with similar interests across the globe, breaking down geographical barriers. I've met many interesting people through online forums dedicated to AI news. On the other hand, the lack of physical cues and the potential for curated online personas can make it harder to determine if a connection is truly genuine. It's easy to have a superficial interaction, but building deep trust takes time and often requires face-to-face contact. Therefore, while technology provides the initial platform for meeting strangers, the "genuineness" of the connection still depends on the effort both parties put into it.

# Q7-1:
Why do many people prefer to buy new household items instead of attempting to repair broken ones?

# A7-1:
In today's consumer-driven society, many people find it more convenient and often cheaper to replace broken items than to fix them. The rapid pace of technological advancement means that newer models frequently offer better features and efficiency, making repairs seem less attractive. Furthermore, many modern products are not designed to be easily disassembled, which discourages DIY efforts. For example, when my Nintendo Switch joystick started drifting, I initially considered buying a new one before deciding to attempt a DIY repair. However, the lack of specialized tools and the high cost of professional repair services often lead consumers to choose the path of least resistance, which is purchasing a brand-new replacement.

# Q7-2:
How has the "throwaway culture" in modern society affected the environment over the last few decades?

# A7-2:
The "throwaway culture" has had a devastating impact on the environment, primarily through the massive accumulation of electronic and plastic waste. As products are discarded more frequently, landfills are becoming overwhelmed, and precious natural resources are being depleted at an unsustainable rate. Moreover, the manufacturing processes for new goods often involve high carbon emissions and pollution. While some progress has been made in recycling, it cannot keep up with the sheer volume of waste generated. I've seen the effects of this even in my small coastal hometown of Mituo, where plastic debris sometimes washes up on the shore. This culture of disposability necessitates a fundamental shift toward more circular and sustainable economic models.

# Q7-3:
Do you think that schools should place more emphasis on teaching practical repair skills to students?

# A7-3:
I strongly believe that schools should reintroduce practical repair skills into their curricula. Teaching students how to fix basic household items or electronics fosters a sense of self-reliance and encourages a more sustainable mindset from a young age. It also helps develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that are applicable in many other areas of life. For instance, learning how to make rubber band guns as a child taught me the basics of mechanical structures. By equipping the younger generation with these skills, we can combat the "throwaway culture" and empower them to make more conscious choices as consumers. Ultimately, such education is essential for building a more resourceful and environmentally responsible society.

# Q8-1:
What are some of the most important skills that the younger generation can learn from older people?

# A8-1:
Older generations possess a wealth of practical skills and life wisdom that are often overlooked in the digital age. Traditional crafts, gardening, and even basic home maintenance are valuable skills that promote sustainability and self-sufficiency. Beyond technical abilities, the younger generation can learn patience, resilience, and the importance of community from their elders. My neighbor, Grandma, taught me the value of storytelling and how to care for old books, which are lessons in preservation and empathy. These "soft skills" are crucial for navigating the complexities of modern life. By bridging the generational gap, we can ensure that these vital pieces of cultural and practical knowledge are not lost to time.

# Q8-2:
How has the relationship between different generations changed as a result of rapid technological advancement?

# A8-2:
Rapid technological change has created a "digital divide" that can sometimes strain relationships between generations. Younger people, who are digital natives, often find it easier to adapt to new tools, while older individuals may feel left behind or overwhelmed. This can lead to a reversal of traditional roles, where children end up teaching their parents or grandparents how to use smartphones or social media. However, technology also provides new ways for families to stay connected, such as video calls or sharing photos instantly. While the pace of change can be challenging, it also offers opportunities for mutual learning and for finding new ways to relate to one another in an increasingly connected world.

# Q8-3:
To what extent should traditional skills be preserved in a society that is becoming increasingly automated?

# A8-3:
I believe it's essential to preserve traditional skills, not just for their practical utility, but for their cultural and historical significance. These skills represent a connection to our past and provide a sense of identity that automation cannot replicate. While machines can perform tasks with greater speed and precision, they lack the human touch and the creative spirit inherent in traditional craftsmanship. For example, the unique fishing techniques used in my hometown of Mituo are a vital part of our local heritage. Preserving these skills ensures that we maintain a diverse range of human capabilities and that we don't become entirely dependent on technology for our basic needs and cultural expression.

# Q9-1:
Why do many people who live in large cities feel the need to visit the countryside during their holidays?

# A9-1:
The primary reason is the desire to escape the relentless pace and sensory overload of urban life. Cities are often characterized by noise, pollution, and high levels of stress, which can take a toll on mental and physical health. In contrast, the countryside offers a peaceful environment, fresh air, and a closer connection to nature. Many people find that spending time in rural areas, like taking sunset walks in my hometown of Mituo, helps them recharge and gain a fresh perspective. This "digital detox" allows individuals to slow down, reflect, and enjoy simpler pleasures, which is increasingly necessary for maintaining a healthy balance in our modern, fast-paced world.

# Q9-2:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing rural areas for the purpose of increasing tourism?

# A9-2:
Developing rural areas for tourism can bring significant economic benefits, such as job creation and improved infrastructure for local communities. It can also help preserve local traditions and crafts by providing a market for them. However, there are notable disadvantages, including the risk of environmental degradation and the loss of the very "authenticity" that attracts tourists in the first place. Over-development can lead to increased traffic, waste, and a rise in the cost of living for residents. For instance, while tourism might help a small village like Mituo, it must be managed carefully to ensure that the peaceful atmosphere and local culture are not compromised by an influx of visitors.

# Q9-3:
How might the migration of people from rural areas to urban centers affect the future of the countryside?

# A9-3:
The migration to cities often leads to a "brain drain" and an aging population in rural areas, as younger people leave in search of better education and job opportunities. This can result in the decline of local businesses, schools, and essential services, making it even harder for those who remain. Furthermore, abandoned farmland and traditional houses can lead to a loss of cultural heritage and biodiversity. However, this trend might also spark a counter-movement where people seek a more sustainable and community-oriented lifestyle back in the countryside. To ensure a vibrant future for rural areas, it's crucial to invest in digital connectivity and sustainable industries that can attract a new generation of residents.

# Q10-1:
What are the most common challenges that people face when they move to a new city or country?

# A10-1:
Moving to a new location often involves significant hurdles, such as language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, and the loss of one's social support network. Adapting to a different pace of life or unfamiliar social norms can be mentally exhausting and may lead to feelings of isolation or homesickness. Additionally, practical issues like finding housing, navigating a new healthcare system, or securing employment can be incredibly stressful. When I moved to Cambridge for my research at Harvard, I initially struggled with the different academic culture and the fast-paced environment. Overcoming these challenges requires resilience, an open mind, and a proactive effort to build new connections and understand the local way of life.

# Q10-2:
How does being in an unfamiliar environment influence a person's perspective on their own culture?

# A10-2:
Being in a new environment often acts as a mirror, highlighting aspects of one's own culture that were previously taken for granted. By experiencing different ways of living and thinking, individuals can gain a more objective and nuanced understanding of their own traditions and values. This can lead to a greater appreciation for certain aspects of their heritage while also fostering a more critical view of others. For example, my trip to Tokyo made me realize how much I valued the relaxed and community-focused atmosphere of my hometown. Ultimately, this cross-cultural exposure encourages a more global mindset and helps people define their own identity in a more conscious and informed way.

# Q10-3:
Do you think that the experience of traveling to new places will become less meaningful as the world becomes more globalized?

# A10-3:
While globalization has made many cities look more similar, I don't believe it will make travel less meaningful. The true value of travel lies in the unique human interactions, local stories, and the personal growth that comes from stepping outside one's comfort zone. Even in a globalized world, every place has its own history, climate, and subtle cultural nuances that cannot be fully captured by international brands. For instance, while I can find Japanese food anywhere, nothing compares to the experience of taking a cake-making class in Shinjuku. Travel will always be meaningful because it challenges our assumptions and provides a direct, sensory experience of the world's diversity that digital screens simply cannot replicate.

# Q11-1:
How important is it for urban planners to include walking paths and green spaces in modern cities?

# A11-1:
It is absolutely crucial because these spaces are essential for the physical and mental well-being of urban residents. Walking paths encourage active transportation, which reduces traffic congestion and pollution, while green spaces provide a much-needed respite from the "concrete jungle." These areas also serve as vital social hubs where people can meet and interact, fostering a sense of community. In my hometown of Mituo, the coastal walking paths are where everyone gathers to enjoy the sunset and connect with neighbors. By prioritizing these elements, urban planners can create more livable, sustainable, and human-centric cities that support a higher quality of life for all citizens, regardless of their background.

# Q11-2:
What are the differences between walking for exercise and walking as a primary means of transportation?

# A11-2:
Walking for exercise is usually a deliberate and leisure-oriented activity, often done in scenic or quiet environments to improve fitness or reduce stress. The focus is on the physical effort and the mental benefits of the movement itself. In contrast, walking as transportation is more functional and goal-oriented, often involving navigating busy streets and adhering to a schedule. While both provide health benefits, the experience is quite different; one is about the journey, while the other is about the destination. For example, my walks in Mituo are for relaxation, whereas my commute in Tokyo was a fast-paced necessity. Both forms are valuable, but they serve different roles in an individual's daily routine.

# Q11-3:
To what extent can regular physical activity like walking improve the overall mental health of a population?

# A11-3:
Regular physical activity has a profound impact on mental health by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and improving overall mood. Walking, in particular, is an accessible and low-impact way to release endorphins and clear the mind. On a population level, encouraging more walking can lead to lower healthcare costs and a more resilient and productive society. I've personally found that a simple walk while listening to podcasts on my noise-cancelling earphones can significantly lower my stress levels after a long day of research. By integrating physical activity into daily life, we can foster a more balanced and mentally healthy population, which is essential for the long-term stability and happiness of any community.

# Q12-1:
What factors contribute to a city becoming famous and attracting millions of tourists every year?

# A12-1:
A city's fame is usually built on a combination of iconic landmarks, a rich cultural heritage, and a vibrant modern atmosphere. Historical significance, such as ancient monuments or world-class museums, provides a strong draw for those interested in the past. Additionally, unique culinary experiences, shopping districts, and a reputation for safety and hospitality play a major role. For instance, Tokyo's blend of traditional temples and futuristic neon lights, like the Shinjuku maze, makes it a top destination. Effective marketing and a well-developed tourism infrastructure also ensure that the city remains accessible and appealing to a global audience, creating a virtuous cycle of popularity and investment.

# Q12-2:
How does the historical architecture of a city compare to modern skyscrapers in terms of cultural value?

# A12-2:
Historical architecture serves as a tangible link to a city's past, embodying the craftsmanship, values, and social structures of previous generations. It provides a sense of continuity and identity that is deeply rooted in local history. Modern skyscrapers, on the other hand, often represent a city's economic power, technological ambition, and its place in the globalized world. While skyscrapers can be architectural marvels, they sometimes lack the unique character and "soul" of older buildings. I think both have value; for example, the traditional houses in Mituo tell a story of our fishing heritage, while the skyscrapers in Tokyo symbolize Japan's rapid modernization. Together, they create a layered and dynamic urban landscape.

# Q12-3:
Do you think that the over-commercialization of famous cities will eventually lead to a decline in their popularity?

# A12-3:
There is a real risk that over-commercialization can erode the very qualities that made a city attractive in the first place. When local businesses are replaced by international chains and historical sites become overcrowded and overpriced, the experience can feel "soulless" and exploitative. This can lead to "tourist fatigue" and a decline in repeat visitors. However, many cities are now recognizing this and are implementing measures to promote sustainable tourism and protect their local character. While commercial success is important, maintaining a balance between economic growth and cultural preservation is essential. If a city loses its unique identity to commercial interests, it may eventually lose its appeal to travelers seeking authentic and meaningful experiences.

# Q13-1:
What role does food play in the celebration of traditional festivals and special occasions in your country?

# A13-1:
Food is central to traditional celebrations, acting as a symbol of unity, prosperity, and cultural heritage. During major festivals like the Lunar New Year, specific dishes are prepared to bring good luck and to honor ancestors. These meals provide a focal point for family gatherings, where sharing food strengthens social bonds and reinforces a sense of belonging. For example, my family always gathers to play Switch games and share a large feast during the holidays. Beyond its nutritional value, festive food carries deep emotional significance, connecting individuals to their roots and creating lasting memories that are passed down through generations.

# Q13-2:
How have eating habits changed over the years regarding the consumption of sweet foods and desserts?

# A13-2:
In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift toward more diverse and sophisticated dessert options, influenced by global culinary trends. While traditional sweets remain popular, many people now enjoy a wide variety of international pastries and cakes. However, there is also a growing awareness of the health risks associated with high sugar consumption, leading to a demand for healthier, low-sugar alternatives. I've noticed this trend in my own hobby of baking, where I often experiment with less refined ingredients. Despite the increased health consciousness, sweet foods continue to play a significant role in social gatherings and as a form of personal indulgence and relaxation in our busy lives.

# Q13-3:
To what degree does the presentation of food at a social event influence the guests' enjoyment of the occasion?

# A13-3:
The presentation of food plays a vital role in shaping the overall guest experience, as we often "eat with our eyes" first. A beautifully arranged dish can create a sense of anticipation and signal that the host has put thought and effort into the event. This attention to detail enhances the perceived value of the meal and can make the occasion feel more special and memorable. For instance, during my cake-making class in Tokyo, I learned that the visual appeal of a dessert is just as important as its taste. While the quality of the food is paramount, a thoughtful presentation elevates the social atmosphere and contributes significantly to the guests' overall satisfaction and enjoyment.

# Q14-1:
Why do some companies offer free products or services to the public as part of their marketing strategy?

# A14-1:
Companies often provide free samples or services to lower the barrier to entry and encourage potential customers to try their brand without financial risk. This strategy helps build brand awareness and can create a sense of reciprocity, where consumers feel more inclined to make a purchase in the future. Moreover, offering something for free can generate positive word-of-mouth and social media buzz, which is highly effective in today's digital landscape. For example, I've received limited-edition merchandise at anime conventions that made me more loyal to certain brands. Ultimately, the goal is to demonstrate value and build a long-term relationship with the customer, turning a one-time user into a loyal advocate.

# Q14-2:
What are the social benefits of community programs that provide free resources to people in need?

# A14-2:
Community programs that offer free resources, such as food banks or public libraries, play a crucial role in reducing social inequality and providing a safety net for vulnerable individuals. These programs ensure that basic needs are met, which can improve overall public health and social stability. Furthermore, they foster a sense of community solidarity and encourage the spirit of giving and mutual support. My neighbor, Grandma, who redistributes old books to local children, is a perfect example of how small-scale community efforts can make a big difference. By providing equal access to resources, these programs empower individuals to improve their lives and contribute more effectively to society.

# Q14-3:
Do you think that the concept of "free" services on the internet has changed people's expectations of value?

# A14-3:
The prevalence of free internet services has certainly shifted public expectations, leading many to believe that digital content and tools should be accessible without direct payment. This has forced companies to find alternative revenue models, such as advertising or data monetization. While this "free" culture has democratized access to information, it has also led to a perceived devaluation of creative work and professional services. I've observed this in the way people consume AI news on Twitter, often expecting high-quality insights for free. Consequently, while the internet has made resources more accessible, it has also made it more challenging for creators to be fairly compensated for their expertise and effort.

# Q15-1:
What are the most common types of events that people in your culture spend a lot of time preparing for?

# A15-1:
In my culture, significant life milestones such as weddings, milestone birthdays, and traditional festivals like the Lunar New Year require extensive preparation. These events are seen as vital opportunities to honor family traditions and strengthen social ties, often involving large gatherings and elaborate rituals. People also invest a great deal of time in organizing community events or hobby-related gatherings, such as the large-scale anime conventions I've attended in Taipei. The preparation process itself, while often stressful, is a way for individuals to show respect for their heritage and to create a meaningful experience for their loved ones and the broader community.

# Q15-2:
How does the pressure of organizing a large social event affect the relationships between family members?

# A15-2:
The high stakes and logistical complexities of organizing a major event can lead to significant stress and occasional conflicts among family members. Differing opinions on budgets, guest lists, or traditional protocols can strain relationships, especially when expectations are high. However, working together toward a common goal can also strengthen family bonds and foster a sense of shared accomplishment. I've seen how the intense preparation for a family party can bring people closer as they navigate challenges together. While the pressure is undeniable, the process of collaboration and the eventual success of the event often lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation for one another's contributions.

# Q15-3:
To what extent has the commercialization of holidays changed the way people prepare for happy events?

# A15-3:
Commercialization has undoubtedly shifted the focus of many holidays toward consumption and gift-giving, often overshadowing the original cultural or spiritual significance. People now spend a considerable amount of time and money on decorations, branded products, and elaborate gifts, driven by marketing and social media trends. This can create a sense of financial pressure and a "keeping up with the Joneses" mentality. For instance, the pressure to buy the latest gadgets or fashion items during holiday sales is quite prevalent. While these modern elements can add excitement, it's important to maintain a balance and ensure that the core values of connection and celebration remain at the heart of our preparations.

# Q16-1:
What are the main differences between living in a house and living in an apartment in a large city?

# A16-1:
Living in a house typically offers more space, privacy, and a sense of ownership, often including a private garden or outdoor area. This can be ideal for families or those who value a quieter lifestyle. In contrast, apartments in large cities are often more centrally located, providing easier access to public transportation, work, and entertainment. While apartments may have less space, they often come with shared amenities like gyms or security services. For example, while I enjoy the peacefulness of my family home in Mituo, I appreciate the convenience of apartment living when I'm in a busy city. Ultimately, the choice depends on an individual's priorities regarding space, convenience, and budget.

# Q16-2:
How has the design of residential buildings changed over the years to accommodate growing populations?

# A16-2:
To address the challenges of urban density, residential designs have moved toward more vertical and multi-functional structures. Modern apartment buildings often incorporate smart technology, energy-efficient systems, and communal spaces to maximize utility within a smaller footprint. There is also a growing emphasis on "mixed-use" developments that combine residential, commercial, and recreational areas in a single complex. I've noticed these trends in the newer developments in Tokyo, which prioritize efficiency and connectivity. These changes reflect a shift toward more sustainable and integrated urban living, where the goal is to provide a high quality of life while making the most of limited urban space.

# Q16-3:
Do you think that the high cost of housing in urban areas will force more people to live in communal spaces in the future?

# A16-3:
I believe that communal living or "co-living" will become an increasingly popular option, especially for young professionals and students in expensive cities. These arrangements offer a more affordable way to live in desirable locations while providing a built-in social network and shared resources. While some may find the lack of total privacy challenging, the benefits of reduced costs and a sense of community can be very appealing. In my own experience during research trips, I've found that shared living spaces can foster collaboration and new friendships. As housing prices continue to rise, communal living represents a practical and socially dynamic solution to the challenges of modern urban life.

# Q17-1:
Why is clothing often considered a popular choice of gift for friends and family members?

# A17-1:
Clothing is a popular gift because it is both practical and personal, allowing the giver to show that they understand the recipient's style and preferences. A well-chosen item of clothing can be a lasting reminder of a special occasion or a close relationship. Furthermore, fashion is a way for people to express their identity, so giving clothes can be a way of supporting someone's self-expression. For instance, I once saved up for months to buy a PUMA jacket, and receiving a similar item as a gift would have been incredibly meaningful. While it requires a good knowledge of the recipient's taste, a thoughtful piece of clothing is often seen as a warm and considerate gesture.

# Q17-2:
How does the fashion industry influence the way people perceive social status and identity?

# A17-2:
The fashion industry plays a significant role in shaping social perceptions by associating certain brands or styles with wealth, success, or specific subcultures. For many, wearing high-end labels is a way to signal their social status and aspirations. At the same time, fashion allows individuals to align themselves with particular groups or movements, such as the fans who wear elaborate costumes at anime conventions. This can create a sense of belonging but also lead to social pressure and the marginalization of those who cannot afford the latest trends. Ultimately, fashion is a powerful tool for self-presentation, but it can also reinforce social hierarchies based on outward appearance.

# Q17-3:
To what extent should the textile industry be held responsible for the environmental impact of "fast fashion"?

# A17-3:
I believe the textile industry bears a significant responsibility for the environmental damage caused by "fast fashion," including water pollution, massive waste, and high carbon emissions. The industry's focus on rapid production and low costs often comes at the expense of environmental standards and fair labor practices. While consumers also play a role through their purchasing choices, the industry must lead the way by adopting more sustainable materials and circular manufacturing processes. From my perspective, stricter regulations and a shift toward "slow fashion" are essential for mitigating the industry's ecological footprint. By prioritizing quality over quantity, the textile industry can help create a more sustainable future for both the planet and the fashion world.
# Q18-1:
Why do you think some parents prefer to buy traditional wooden toys rather than electronic ones for their children?

# A18-1:
I believe there are a few key reasons for this preference. Firstly, wooden toys are often perceived as more durable and environmentally friendly compared to their plastic, electronic counterparts. Moreover, many parents feel that traditional toys encourage more open-ended, imaginative play. Unlike electronic gadgets that often have pre-programmed functions, a simple wooden block can become anything a child imagines. For instance, when I was younger, I used to spend hours making rubber band guns out of simple wood scraps, which felt far more rewarding than playing a scripted video game. Therefore, parents often choose these toys to foster creativity and reduce excessive screen time from an early age.

# Q18-2:
In what ways have the types of toys children play with changed compared to those of previous generations?

# A18-2:
The landscape of childhood play has shifted dramatically, primarily due to the rapid advancement of technology. In the past, toys were largely physical and mechanical, such as dolls, marbles, or the handmade rubber band guns I enjoyed as a child. However, contemporary toys are increasingly digital and interactive. Many children now prefer tablets or consoles like the Nintendo Switch, which offer immersive virtual experiences. While these modern devices provide high levels of engagement and can even be educational, they often lack the tactile and outdoor elements that characterized the play of previous generations. Consequently, there is a growing concern about the sedentary nature of modern play.

# Q18-3:
To what extent do you agree that toys play a critical role in the cognitive development of a child?

# A18-3:
I strongly agree that toys are essential tools for a child's mental growth. They serve as the primary medium through which children explore the world and develop problem-solving skills. For example, building sets or puzzles require logical thinking and spatial awareness. Furthermore, interactive games, such as the party games we play on the Switch during family gatherings, can enhance social cognition and quick decision-making. Although some might argue that social interaction is more important, toys often act as the catalyst for that interaction. In conclusion, toys are not merely for entertainment; they are fundamental instruments that shape a child's cognitive and social abilities.

# Q19-1:
How important is it for people to consider the personality of a friend when choosing a gift for them?

# A19-1:
It is absolutely crucial to take a friend's personality into account to ensure the gift is meaningful. A well-chosen present demonstrates that you truly understand and value the recipient's interests. For instance, if I were buying a gift for my close friend YiLin, I would look for something related to our shared trip to Tokyo or her specific hobbies, rather than a generic item. Moreover, a gift that clashes with someone's personality might even cause awkwardness. While the gesture itself is important, the thoughtfulness behind a personalized gift strengthens the bond between friends. Therefore, tailoring a gift to a friend's character is the hallmark of a good friendship.

# Q19-2:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving money instead of a physical gift on special occasions?

# A19-2:
Giving money has both clear benefits and notable drawbacks. On the positive side, it offers the recipient the flexibility to purchase exactly what they need or want, which eliminates the risk of giving a useless item. This is particularly practical during events like Chinese New Year. However, the primary disadvantage is that cash can often seem impersonal or lacking in effort. Unlike a physical gift, such as a limited-edition item from an anime convention, money doesn't carry a specific memory or personal touch. In conclusion, while money is undeniably practical, it may fail to convey the same level of emotional depth as a carefully selected physical present.

# Q19-3:
Do you think the commercialization of gift-giving has changed the way people perceive the value of friendship?

# A19-3:
Unfortunately, I believe the heavy commercialization of holidays has somewhat distorted the perception of friendship. Nowadays, there is often an underlying pressure to buy expensive items to prove one's affection, which can shift the focus from emotional connection to material wealth. For example, during large events like anime conventions, people sometimes focus more on the price of limited merch than the shared experience. Nevertheless, true friendship is still defined by support and shared memories rather than the cost of a gift. While marketing campaigns try to equate spending with caring, most people still recognize that a friend's presence is far more valuable than any commercial product.

# Q20-1:
Why do you think some people find it much easier to learn a foreign language than others?

# A20-1:
There are several factors that contribute to this disparity. Firstly, some individuals may have a natural linguistic aptitude or a "good ear" for sounds, which helps them mimic pronunciation more accurately. Additionally, motivation and immersion play a significant role. For instance, during my five-day trip to Tokyo, I found that being forced to navigate the Shinjuku maze made me learn basic Japanese phrases much faster than classroom study ever did. Moreover, those who use tools like noise-cancelling earphones to listen to foreign podcasts during their commute tend to progress more quickly. Ultimately, while talent matters, consistent exposure and a genuine need to communicate are the most decisive factors.

# Q20-2:
How has the use of technology changed the way languages are taught in schools today?

# A20-2:
Technology has revolutionized language education by making it more interactive and accessible. In the past, learning was largely confined to textbooks and repetitive drills. However, modern classrooms now utilize multimedia resources, such as language apps and online videos, which provide authentic cultural context. For example, students can now use high-quality earphones to practice listening skills with native speakers via podcasts. Furthermore, digital platforms allow for real-time collaboration with students from other countries. Although the teacher's role remains vital, technology has shifted the focus from passive memorization to active communication, making the learning process significantly more engaging and effective for the digital generation.

# Q20-3:
Do you think that a global language will eventually replace the need for people to learn minority languages?

# A20-3:
While a global language like English is becoming increasingly dominant for international trade and science, I do not believe it will entirely replace minority languages. Language is deeply intertwined with cultural identity and heritage. For many, speaking their native tongue is a way to maintain a connection to their roots, much like the unique dialect spoken in my hometown, Mituo. Moreover, there is a growing global movement to preserve linguistic diversity as a form of cultural wealth. Although learning a global language is practical for career advancement, minority languages offer a unique worldview that cannot be translated. Therefore, both will likely coexist, serving different purposes in a globalized world.

# Q21-1:
What role does music play in the cultural identity of a nation?

# A21-1:
Music serves as a powerful symbol of a nation's history, values, and traditions. It often reflects the unique experiences of a people, acting as an auditory representation of their heritage. For example, traditional folk songs can tell stories of a country's past, much like the tales my neighbor, Grandma, tells about our village. Furthermore, music can unify a population during national events or celebrations, fostering a sense of belonging. While modern music is becoming more globalized, local genres still maintain distinct characteristics that differentiate one culture from another. In essence, music is a vital thread in the cultural fabric that binds a society together.

# Q21-2:
How has the way people consume music changed with the rise of digital streaming platforms?

# A21-2:
The transition from physical media to digital streaming has fundamentally altered our relationship with music. Previously, people would buy albums or save up for specific items, but now, millions of songs are available instantly for a monthly fee. This has made music consumption much more convenient and diverse. For instance, I often use my noise-cancelling earphones to explore new genres while commuting. However, this abundance can sometimes lead to a shorter attention span, as listeners frequently skip tracks. While streaming has democratized access to music, it has also changed music from a prized possession into a ubiquitous background utility in our daily lives.

# Q21-3:
To what extent do you agree that music has the power to influence the behavior and emotions of a society?

# A21-3:
I believe music has a profound impact on both individual emotions and collective social behavior. On a personal level, upbeat music can boost productivity, while calming melodies are excellent for relaxation after a long day. On a larger scale, music has historically been used as a tool for social change, with protest songs galvanizing movements and creating a shared sense of purpose. For example, the high-energy atmosphere at an anime convention is largely driven by the iconic theme songs that unite the fans. Although music alone cannot change laws, it can certainly shift public sentiment and inspire people to act, making it a potent social force.

# Q22-1:
How important is it for individuals to have clear ambitions in their professional lives?

# A22-1:
Having clear ambitions is vital as it provides a sense of direction and motivation. Without specific goals, it is easy to become stagnant or lose focus in one's career. For instance, my ambition to excel in quantum machine learning has driven me to give academic presentations at prestigious venues like Harvard. Moreover, clear objectives allow individuals to measure their progress and make informed decisions about their professional development. While it is important to remain flexible, having a "north star" helps in navigating the complexities of the modern job market. Ultimately, ambition is the engine that transforms potential into tangible professional achievements.

# Q22-2:
What are the main factors that prevent people from achieving their long-term goals?

# A22-2:
Several obstacles can hinder the achievement of long-term objectives. One primary factor is a lack of persistence or the tendency to become discouraged by initial failures. Additionally, external pressures, such as financial constraints or family obligations, can divert a person's focus. For example, someone might dream of attending a major anime convention as a VIP, but the high cost and limited availability of tickets can be a significant barrier. Furthermore, poor time management and the distractions of modern life, like social media, often prevent people from dedicating the necessary effort to their goals. In conclusion, overcoming these internal and external hurdles requires both resilience and disciplined planning.

# Q22-3:
Do you think society puts too much pressure on young people to be successful at an early age?

# A22-3:
Yes, I believe there is an excessive amount of pressure on the younger generation to achieve "success" prematurely. Social media often showcases "young achievers," which creates an unrealistic benchmark for others. This can lead to significant stress and a fear of failure. For instance, the intense competition for limited merch at conventions or top spots in academic research can be overwhelming for students. While encouraging excellence is positive, it should not come at the expense of mental health or the opportunity to explore different paths. Society should recognize that success is a marathon, not a sprint, and that everyone develops at their own pace.

# Q23-1:
Why do you think it is necessary for schools and workplaces to have a strict set of rules?

# A23-1:
Strict rules are essential for maintaining order, safety, and fairness within any organization. In a school setting, regulations ensure that all students have a conducive environment for learning and that discipline is upheld. Similarly, in the workplace, rules regarding conduct and safety protocols prevent chaos and protect employees' rights. For example, at a packed anime convention, strict entry rules and VIP pass systems are necessary to manage the crowd and ensure everyone's safety. Without these guidelines, it would be difficult to achieve collective goals or ensure that everyone is treated equally. Therefore, while they may seem restrictive, rules provide the necessary structure for a functional society.

# Q23-2:
How can a lack of flexibility in regulations affect the productivity and morale of employees?

# A23-2:
While rules are necessary, an absolute lack of flexibility can be highly detrimental to an organization. When regulations are too rigid, they can stifle creativity and prevent employees from finding more efficient ways to work. This often leads to frustration and a decline in morale, as workers feel like cogs in a machine rather than valued contributors. For instance, if a workplace has an inflexible "no personal devices" rule, an employee might not be able to use their noise-cancelling earphones to focus in a loud office. Consequently, productivity may actually drop. A balanced approach that combines clear guidelines with reasonable exceptions is usually the most effective strategy.

# Q23-3:
Do you think that rules in society will become more or less relaxed in the future?

# A23-3:
I believe we will see a dual trend where some rules become more relaxed while others become stricter. On one hand, social norms regarding lifestyle and personal expression are becoming increasingly flexible in many cultures. However, on the other hand, regulations concerning data privacy, AI, and environmental protection are likely to become much more stringent. For example, as we rely more on mobile payments and digital news, new laws will be needed to prevent fraud. While we might enjoy more personal freedom in our daily lives, the complexities of modern technology will necessitate a more robust legal framework to ensure the stability and safety of society.

# Q24-1:
What are some things, other than technology, that people in your country consider essential for daily life?

# A24-1:
Beyond technology, many people in my country consider access to nature and community spaces as essential for a balanced life. For instance, in my hometown of Mituo, the daily sunset walks along the coast are a vital ritual for many residents. Moreover, reliable public infrastructure and affordable healthcare are seen as fundamental necessities. While digital tools are ubiquitous, the physical environment and social support networks remain the bedrock of daily well-being. Additionally, traditional food markets continue to play a crucial role in both nutrition and social interaction. Therefore, while technology is important, these tangible and social elements are equally indispensable for a high quality of life.

# Q24-2:
How does the level of consumerism in a society affect what people believe they cannot live without?

# A24-2:
High levels of consumerism often inflate our perceived needs, leading us to believe that luxury items are essential. Marketing campaigns constantly create a sense of urgency, suggesting that our happiness depends on owning the latest products. For example, many feel they cannot live without high-end noise-cancelling earphones, even if simpler models would suffice. This culture of consumption can shift our focus from functional utility to social status. Consequently, people often become trapped in a cycle of upgrading possessions, which can lead to financial stress and environmental waste. In conclusion, consumerism distorts our priorities, making us equate material abundance with basic survival.

# Q24-3:
To what extent do you think people's reliance on physical possessions has increased over the last few decades?

# A24-3:
I believe our reliance on physical possessions has increased significantly, though the nature of these possessions has changed. While we may own fewer bulky items due to digitalization, our dependence on specific high-tech gadgets has intensified. For instance, many people feel completely lost without their smartphones or consoles like the Switch. Furthermore, the rise of fast fashion has led to an accumulation of clothing that people feel is necessary for their self-image. Although some are moving towards minimalism, the majority of society still measures success and comfort through the lens of ownership. Thus, while the form of our possessions has evolved, our psychological reliance on them remains stronger than ever.

# Q25-1:
What qualities make a teacher effective at delivering a memorable lesson?

# A25-1:
An effective teacher must possess both deep subject knowledge and the ability to inspire curiosity. Memorable lessons often involve hands-on experiences rather than just passive listening. For example, my science teacher used to conduct fascinating experiments every Wednesday, which made complex theories come alive. Moreover, a good teacher should be empathetic and able to adapt their style to different learners. By using storytelling and real-world examples, they can make the material more relatable. While academic rigor is important, it is the passion and creativity of the educator that truly leaves a lasting impression on students. Therefore, inspiration is just as vital as information in the classroom.

# Q25-2:
In what ways does the environment of a classroom affect the ability of students to retain information?

# A25-2:
The physical and emotional environment of a classroom plays a critical role in the learning process. A well-organized, brightly lit space can enhance focus and reduce fatigue. Conversely, a cramped or noisy environment can be highly distracting. For instance, during my cake-making class in Tokyo, the clean and professional setting helped me concentrate on the intricate steps. Furthermore, a supportive atmosphere where students feel safe to ask questions is essential for deep understanding. If the environment is overly stressful, the brain's ability to process and store new information is significantly impaired. In conclusion, a positive and stimulating classroom environment is a prerequisite for effective learning.

# Q25-3:
Do you think that traditional classroom-based learning will eventually be replaced by online education?

# A25-3:
While online education offers unprecedented flexibility and access to resources, I do not believe it will entirely replace traditional classrooms. The physical classroom provides essential social interactions and immediate feedback that are difficult to replicate virtually. For example, the collaborative energy of a science lab or a group discussion is vital for developing soft skills. However, online platforms are excellent for self-paced learning and specialized subjects like quantum research. I anticipate a "hybrid" model becoming the standard, where digital tools complement face-to-face instruction. Ultimately, the human element of teaching and the structured environment of a school remain too valuable to be completely discarded.

# Q26-1:
Why do some people feel a strong sense of responsibility to help others in their local community?

# A26-1:
This sense of responsibility often stems from a deep-seated belief in social cohesion and empathy. Many individuals feel that by contributing to their community, they are creating a better environment for everyone, including themselves. For instance, my neighbor, Grandma, spends her days collecting and redistributing old books to ensure everyone has access to knowledge. This altruism is often driven by a desire to give back or a sense of moral duty. Moreover, helping others can provide a significant sense of personal fulfillment and purpose. While some may be motivated by religious or ethical values, the underlying goal is usually to foster a more supportive and resilient local society.

# Q26-2:
How has the level of neighborliness in urban areas changed over the last few years?

# A26-2:
In many modern cities, the traditional sense of neighborliness has unfortunately declined due to busy lifestyles and the anonymity of urban living. People often spend more time commuting or on their devices than interacting with those living next door. However, there are still pockets of strong community spirit. For example, in my coastal village, neighbors still look out for one another and share stories. Interestingly, technology has also created new forms of neighborliness through local social media groups. While face-to-face interactions may be less frequent, these digital platforms allow residents to share information and help each other in new ways. Thus, neighborliness is evolving rather than simply disappearing.

# Q26-3:
What role should the government play in encouraging citizens to participate in voluntary work?

# A26-3:
The government should play a proactive role by creating a supportive framework for volunteering. This can include providing funding for local charities, offering tax incentives, or integrating community service into the school curriculum. For instance, if the government promoted science outreach programs, more professionals might volunteer to teach experiments like my science teacher did. Furthermore, public recognition and awards for outstanding volunteers can help raise the profile of such work. While volunteering should remain a choice, the government can lower the barriers to entry and highlight the benefits to both the individual and society. In conclusion, state support is essential for fostering a robust culture of volunteerism.

# Q27-1:
What are the main reasons why some people become popular or famous in their local communities?

# A27-1:
Local popularity is often built on a foundation of consistent contribution and a charismatic personality. Individuals who are seen as helpful, such as my neighbor Grandma who redistributes books, naturally gain the respect and admiration of their peers. Additionally, those who excel in a particular field, like a dedicated science teacher or a successful local athlete, often become well-known figures. Social media has also made it easier for people to gain a following by sharing local news or organizing community events. Ultimately, popularity in a small community is usually a reflection of a person's impact on the lives of those around them and their visibility in local social circles.

# Q27-2:
How does being a popular figure in society affect an individual's right to privacy?

# A27-2:
Being a public figure often leads to a significant erosion of personal privacy. When someone becomes popular, their actions and personal life are frequently scrutinized by the public and the media. This can be particularly challenging in the age of social media, where every move can be recorded and shared instantly. For example, a famous scientist or a VIP at a convention might find it difficult to enjoy a quiet meal without being recognized. While some argue that this is the price of fame, everyone deserves a private sphere. Therefore, it is important for society to maintain a balance between public interest and an individual's right to a private life.

# Q27-3:
Do you think that the qualities people look for in a role model have changed over time?

# A27-3:
I believe there has been a shift from valuing traditional authority figures to admiring those who demonstrate authenticity and social responsibility. In the past, role models were often distant figures of power or wealth. However, today's generation tends to look for individuals who are relatable and stand up for important causes. For instance, a science teacher who makes learning fun or an activist who protects the environment might be seen as more inspiring than a generic celebrity. Moreover, the rise of the internet has allowed for a more diverse range of role models from various backgrounds. In conclusion, we now prioritize character, transparency, and positive social impact over mere status.

# Q28-1:
How important is it for children to have positive experiences during their early years?

# A28-1:
Positive early experiences are absolutely fundamental as they lay the groundwork for a child's future emotional and cognitive health. During these formative years, the brain is highly plastic, and supportive interactions help build a strong foundation for learning and resilience. For example, my childhood memories of making rubber band guns taught me creativity and persistence in a fun way. Conversely, negative experiences can have long-lasting detrimental effects. A happy childhood provides the security and confidence needed to explore the world and form healthy relationships later in life. Therefore, ensuring that children have a safe and stimulating environment is one of the most important investments a society can make.

# Q28-2:
In what ways do childhood memories influence the personality and behavior of an adult?

# A28-2:
Childhood memories act as a blueprint for our adult identity and behavior. The lessons we learn and the emotions we experience as children often shape our values and how we react to challenges. For instance, the excitement I felt at an anime convention as a youth has fostered a lifelong passion for technology and creative storytelling. Moreover, positive memories of community support can lead to a more altruistic adult personality. On the other hand, unresolved childhood issues can manifest as anxieties or behavioral patterns in adulthood. In essence, our past experiences provide the context through which we interpret our current lives, making childhood a critical period for personality development.

# Q28-3:
Do you think that children today have more opportunities for happy experiences than children in the past?

# A28-3:
This is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, modern children have access to an incredible array of educational and entertainment resources, such as the Switch or global travel. For example, a trip to Tokyo is much more common now than it was decades ago. However, on the other hand, children today face unique pressures from social media and a more competitive academic environment. In the past, play was often simpler and more outdoors-oriented, like my experience making rubber band guns. While the opportunities for diverse experiences have certainly increased, the quality of a "happy" childhood still depends more on emotional support than material abundance.

# Q29-1:
Why do you think many people still enjoy playing traditional games even though digital games are available?

# A29-1:
Traditional games offer a tactile and social experience that digital platforms often struggle to replicate. There is a unique joy in the physical interaction of board games or the craftsmanship of making something like a rubber band gun. Moreover, these games often facilitate deeper face-to-face communication and bonding. For instance, during family gatherings, we often put away our devices to play simple party games together. Traditional games also provide a much-needed break from screen time, which is increasingly important in our digital age. While video games are immersive, the simplicity and social warmth of traditional play ensure its enduring popularity across generations.

# Q29-2:
How does playing competitive games as a child prepare an individual for adult life?

# A29-2:
Competitive games serve as a safe environment for children to learn essential life skills such as sportsmanship, strategic thinking, and resilience. By experiencing both victory and defeat, children learn how to handle success with grace and failure with determination. For example, playing intense matches on the Switch requires quick decision-making and teamwork, which are vital in any professional setting. Furthermore, competition encourages individuals to push their limits and improve their skills. While the focus should remain on fun, the underlying lessons in discipline and perseverance are invaluable. Ultimately, these games provide a microcosm of the challenges and rewards that one will encounter in the adult world.

# Q29-3:
To what extent do you agree that games should be used as a primary tool for education in schools?

# A29-3:
I believe that games can be a highly effective secondary tool for education, but they should not necessarily be the primary method. Gamification can significantly increase student engagement and make difficult concepts more accessible. For instance, my science teacher used game-like experiments to teach complex theories, which was incredibly effective. However, some subjects require a level of deep, focused study that games might oversimplify. A primary reliance on games could also lead to a shorter attention span for non-gamified tasks. Therefore, while games are excellent for motivation and practical application, they should be integrated into a broader, more diverse curriculum that includes traditional analytical methods.

# Q30-1:
What are the advantages of traveling by car compared to using public transport for long journeys?

# A30-1:
Traveling by car offers unparalleled flexibility and convenience, especially for long-distance trips. Unlike public transport, which operates on fixed schedules and routes, a car allows travelers to depart at their own pace and take spontaneous detours. For example, when I drive to Kenting for scuba diving, I can stop whenever I want to enjoy the coastal scenery. Moreover, cars provide a private space for passengers and more room for luggage. While public transport is often more environmentally friendly, the door-to-door service and comfort of a personal vehicle make it a preferred choice for many families and individuals seeking a more personalized travel experience.

# Q30-2:
How has the increase in car ownership affected the environment and the layout of modern cities?

# A30-2:
The surge in car ownership has had a profound impact on both the environment and urban planning. Environmentally, the increased emissions have contributed significantly to air pollution and climate change. In terms of city layout, the need to accommodate millions of vehicles has led to the expansion of road networks and the proliferation of parking lots, often at the expense of green spaces. For instance, many modern cities are now designed around highways rather than pedestrian-friendly zones. While cars offer mobility, this "car-centric" development has created challenges such as traffic congestion and urban sprawl. Consequently, many cities are now trying to reintegrate public transport and cycling paths to mitigate these effects.

# Q30-3:
Do you think that autonomous or self-driving cars will become the standard mode of transport in the future?

# A30-3:
I believe that autonomous vehicles will eventually become the standard, although the transition will likely take several decades. The primary advantage of self-driving technology is the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error. Furthermore, autonomous cars could optimize traffic flow and increase fuel efficiency through advanced AI algorithms. For example, as someone who follows AI news on Twitter, I see constant progress in this field. However, there are still major hurdles to overcome, including ethical dilemmas, cybersecurity risks, and the need for updated infrastructure. While we are still in the early stages, the long-term benefits of safety and efficiency make the widespread adoption of autonomous transport almost inevitable.

# Q31-1:
What are the most common types of important decisions that young people have to make today?

# A31-1:
Young people today face a myriad of life-altering decisions, primarily centered around education and career paths. Choosing a university major or deciding whether to pursue a specialized field like quantum research are critical choices that shape their future. Additionally, financial decisions, such as managing student loans or saving for a first home, are increasingly complex. For instance, my friend YiLin and I often discuss the trade-offs between job stability and following one's passion. Social decisions, including when to start a family or where to live, also carry significant weight. In a rapidly changing world, these choices are often more daunting than those faced by previous generations due to the sheer number of available options.

# Q31-2:
How does the availability of too much information make the decision-making process more difficult?

# A31-2:
While access to information is generally positive, an overabundance of data can lead to "analysis paralysis." When faced with too many choices and conflicting opinions, individuals often struggle to identify the most relevant facts. For example, when trying to buy a VIP pass for an anime convention, the flood of different ticket tiers and reviews can be overwhelming. This information overload can cause significant stress and a fear of making the "wrong" choice. Moreover, the presence of biased or false information online further complicates the process. Therefore, the ability to filter and synthesize information has become a more critical skill than simply finding the information itself.

# Q31-3:
To what extent should people rely on their intuition rather than logic when making life-changing choices?

# A31-3:
I believe that a balanced approach, combining both logic and intuition, is the most effective way to make major life decisions. Logic provides a structured framework for evaluating facts and potential outcomes, which is essential for minimizing risk. However, intuition often reflects our underlying values and emotional needs that data cannot capture. For instance, when I decided to pursue a career in AI, I used logic to assess the market demand, but it was my intuitive passion for the subject that truly drove the decision. While logic prevents us from making reckless choices, intuition ensures that our decisions align with our true selves. Thus, neither should be used in isolation.

# Q32-1:
What are the most common sources of incorrect information in the modern world?

# A32-1:
In the digital age, social media platforms have become the primary sources of misinformation. The ease with which anyone can publish content means that unverified rumors can spread globally in seconds. For example, during major events like an anime convention, false information about merch availability often circulates rapidly. Additionally, "clickbait" headlines and biased news outlets often prioritize engagement over accuracy. While traditional media is not immune to errors, the lack of editorial oversight on the internet makes it a breeding ground for "fake news." Therefore, it is increasingly difficult for the average person to distinguish between factual reporting and deliberate manipulation or simple human error.

# Q32-2:
How can the spread of false information on social media affect the stability of a society?

# A32-2:
The rapid dissemination of false information can have devastating effects on social stability. It can polarize public opinion, erode trust in institutions, and even incite violence. When people are exposed to "echo chambers" that reinforce their biases with misinformation, constructive dialogue becomes nearly impossible. For instance, false health advice or political rumors can lead to widespread panic or social unrest. Moreover, the erosion of a shared reality makes it difficult for a society to address collective challenges like climate change. In conclusion, the weaponization of information on social media is one of the greatest threats to the cohesion and functionality of modern democratic societies.

# Q32-3:
What measures should be taken to ensure that the public has access to reliable and accurate news?

# A32-3:
Ensuring access to accurate news requires a multi-faceted approach involving technology, education, and regulation. Firstly, social media companies must take more responsibility for fact-checking and removing harmful misinformation. Secondly, media literacy should be a core part of the school curriculum to teach students how to critically evaluate sources. For example, my science teacher always emphasized the importance of verifying data before drawing conclusions. Finally, supporting independent, high-quality journalism through public funding or subscriptions is essential. While we cannot eliminate all false information, we can empower the public with the tools and resources needed to navigate the complex information landscape more effectively and safely.

# Q33-1:
Why do some people feel the need to give very expensive gifts to show their appreciation?

# A33-1:
The desire to give expensive gifts often stems from a cultural or personal belief that the financial value of a present is a direct reflection of one's level of gratitude. In some societies, high-priced items are seen as a status symbol and a way to demonstrate one's own success and generosity. For instance, I remember saving my allowance for months just to buy a PUMA jacket, which I felt was a significant gesture at the time. Moreover, some people use expensive gifts to compensate for a lack of time or emotional presence. While the intention is usually positive, this focus on cost can sometimes overshadow the genuine sentiment behind the act of giving.

# Q33-2:
How does the culture of giving expensive gifts vary between different countries or societies?

# A33-2:
Gift-giving traditions are deeply rooted in cultural values and vary significantly across the globe. In many East Asian cultures, for example, there is a strong emphasis on "reciprocity" and "face," where giving an expensive gift is a way to show respect and maintain social harmony. Conversely, in many Western societies, the focus is often more on the personal relevance and "thoughtfulness" of the gift rather than its price tag. For instance, a handmade item might be valued more than a luxury brand. While globalization is blurring these lines, the underlying motivations—whether they are social obligation or personal expression—continue to differentiate how different societies perceive the value of a gift.

# Q33-3:
Do you think that the sentimental value of a gift is becoming less important than its financial cost?

# A33-3:
Unfortunately, I believe that the rise of consumerism has led many to prioritize the financial cost of a gift over its sentimental value. The constant exposure to luxury brands and the pressure to "keep up with the Joneses" often make people feel that a cheap gift is inadequate. For example, at an anime convention, the focus is often on the price of limited-edition merch rather than the memory of the event. However, I still believe that most people truly cherish gifts that have a personal story or emotional connection. While the market pushes us towards materialism, the most enduring gifts are those that reflect a deep understanding of the recipient's heart.

# Q34-1:
How important is it for people to follow the latest fashion trends in their choice of clothing?

# A34-1:
The importance of following fashion trends varies greatly depending on an individual's social and professional environment. For some, staying "on trend" is a way to express their identity and feel a sense of belonging to a particular group. For instance, when I bought my PUMA jacket, I felt a sense of pride in wearing a popular brand. However, for others, comfort and personal style are far more important than fleeting trends. While fashion can be a fun form of self-expression, becoming a "slave to fashion" can lead to unnecessary spending and a lack of individuality. Ultimately, the most important thing is to wear clothes that make one feel confident and authentic.

# Q34-2:
In what ways can the clothes a person wears influence the way they are perceived by others in a professional setting?

# A34-2:
In a professional context, clothing serves as a powerful non-verbal cue that can influence perceptions of competence, authority, and reliability. Dressing appropriately for one's role demonstrates respect for the organization and its clients. For example, wearing a suit to an academic presentation at Harvard conveys a level of seriousness and professionalism. Conversely, overly casual attire might be interpreted as a lack of discipline or interest. While "judging a book by its cover" is often criticized, first impressions are frequently based on appearance. Therefore, choosing the right attire is a strategic way to project a positive professional image and build trust with colleagues and partners.

# Q34-3:
To what extent do you think the global fashion industry contributes to environmental problems?

# A34-3:
I believe the global fashion industry is a major contributor to environmental degradation, primarily through the rise of "fast fashion." The mass production of cheap clothing leads to immense water consumption, chemical pollution from dyes, and a staggering amount of textile waste. Moreover, the long supply chains result in a high carbon footprint. For instance, the trend of buying a new jacket every season, like the PUMA one I once coveted, is simply not sustainable. While some brands are moving towards eco-friendly materials and ethical production, the overall industry still prioritizes profit over the planet. Therefore, a fundamental shift in consumer behavior and industry regulations is needed to mitigate these environmental impacts.
# Q35-1:
Why do you think some people are more attracted to dangerous activities than others?

# A35-1:
I believe the attraction to dangerous activities is primarily driven by individual psychological profiles and the physiological desire for a dopamine rush. Some people possess a higher tolerance for risk and seek out "flow states" that only high-stakes environments can provide. For instance, while I was beginner scuba diving in Kenting, I noticed that the initial fear quickly transformed into a profound sense of exhilaration. Furthermore, modern life can often feel overly regulated and predictable; therefore, engaging in extreme sports offers a necessary escape from the mundane. Ultimately, it is a combination of innate personality traits and a reaction against the safety-first nature of contemporary society.

# Q35-2:
In what ways can international travel change a person's perspective on their own culture?

# A35-2:
International travel serves as a powerful catalyst for self-reflection by providing a comparative framework through which one views their own heritage. When individuals encounter different social norms and values, they often begin to question the "default" settings of their home country. For example, during my five-day trip to Tokyo, the extreme politeness and efficiency of the locals made me realize how chaotic certain aspects of my own culture can be. Moreover, experiencing foreign traditions can foster a deeper appreciation for one's own roots while simultaneously highlighting areas for improvement. Consequently, travel encourages a more objective and nuanced understanding of cultural identity rather than a purely ethnocentric one.

# Q35-3:
To what extent do you agree that modern technology has reduced the sense of adventure in travel?

# A35-3:
I partially agree that technology has diminished the raw unpredictability of travel, although it has also made exploration more accessible. With GPS and instant translation apps, the risk of getting truly lost or being unable to communicate is significantly lower. While navigating the Shinjuku maze in Tokyo, I relied heavily on my phone, which arguably removed the "adventure" of finding my own way. However, technology also allows travelers to discover hidden gems that were previously inaccessible to the general public. In conclusion, while the traditional "pioneer" spirit might be fading, technology has replaced it with a more efficient and data-driven form of exploration.

# Q36-1:
How important is it for children to learn how to swim at a young age?

# A36-1:
In my opinion, learning to swim during childhood is absolutely vital, primarily for safety reasons. Drowning remains a significant risk globally, and early exposure to water helps children develop the necessary survival skills and confidence. Beyond safety, swimming is an excellent full-body workout that promotes physical health and coordination. For instance, my own experience with scuba diving in Kenting made me realize how fundamental basic swimming skills are for enjoying more advanced water sports later in life. Furthermore, it fosters a sense of discipline and persistence. Therefore, swimming should be considered an essential life skill rather than just a recreational hobby for the younger generation.

# Q36-2:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing coastal areas for water sports tourism?

# A36-2:
Developing coastal regions for tourism offers significant economic benefits but also poses environmental risks. On the positive side, it creates jobs for local communities and generates revenue that can be used for infrastructure improvements. However, the influx of tourists can lead to habitat destruction and pollution. For example, in Kenting, the popularity of diving and snorkeling has put immense pressure on the local coral reefs. Moreover, over-development can sometimes strip a coastal village of its original charm and tranquility. In conclusion, while tourism can revitalize a local economy, it must be managed sustainably to ensure that the natural beauty of the coast is preserved for future generations.

# Q36-3:
Do you think that interest in unconventional sports will continue to grow in the future?

# A36-3:
I am convinced that interest in niche or unconventional sports will continue to rise, largely due to the influence of social media and the desire for unique experiences. People are increasingly looking for ways to stand out and challenge themselves beyond traditional sports like football or basketball. For instance, the growing popularity of activities like scuba diving or extreme hiking suggests a shift toward more experiential and adventurous hobbies. Additionally, digital platforms allow enthusiasts to share their experiences and build global communities around these activities. Consequently, as people seek more personalized and thrilling ways to stay active, unconventional sports will likely move closer to the mainstream.

# Q37-1:
Why do you think it is important for a country to maintain its traditional celebrations?

# A37-1:
Maintaining traditional celebrations is crucial because they serve as the bedrock of a nation's cultural identity and social cohesion. These events provide a sense of continuity and belonging, connecting the present generation with their ancestors. For example, during the Chinese New Year family parties, playing games on the Switch has become a new way for us to bond while still honoring the spirit of the holiday. Furthermore, traditions offer a unique opportunity for cultural exchange and can even boost tourism. Ultimately, without these celebrations, a society risks losing its historical narrative and becoming culturally homogenized in an increasingly globalized world.

# Q37-2:
How have the ways people celebrate traditional festivals changed over the last few decades?

# A37-2:
The celebration of traditional festivals has undergone a significant transformation, shifting from purely religious or communal rituals to more family-oriented and tech-integrated events. In the past, festivals were often centered around local temples or community gatherings; however, modern celebrations are frequently held in private homes. For instance, my family now incorporates modern entertainment like Nintendo Switch games into our Lunar New Year festivities to keep the younger generation engaged. Additionally, the rise of social media means that people now share their celebrations with a wider audience online. Thus, while the core values of these festivals remain, the methods of observance have become more modernized and digital.

# Q37-3:
To what extent is the commercialization of traditional festivals a negative development for society?

# A37-3:
While commercialization can help keep traditions alive by making them more visible, I believe it is largely a negative development because it often dilutes the original meaning of the festival. When the focus shifts toward consumption and profit, the spiritual or historical significance can be overshadowed by marketing campaigns. For example, many festivals now feel more like shopping events than cultural milestones. On the other hand, commercial interest can provide the funding necessary to organize large-scale public events that bring people together. In conclusion, a balance must be struck to ensure that the essence of the tradition is not sacrificed on the altar of commercial gain.

# Q38-1:
What role do grandparents play in the upbringing of children in your society?

# A38-1:
In many Asian societies, grandparents play a pivotal role as both caregivers and moral guides. They often provide childcare while parents are at work, ensuring that traditional values and family stories are passed down to the younger generation. For instance, my elderly neighbor, who collects and redistributes old books, often shares wisdom with the local children, acting as a community storyteller. Moreover, grandparents offer a sense of emotional stability and unconditional love that is vital for a child's development. Consequently, they are not just family members but essential pillars of the household who bridge the gap between the past and the future.

# Q38-2:
How does the environment in which a child grows up affect their personality as an adult?

# A38-2:
The environment of one's upbringing is a fundamental determinant of adult personality, as it shapes one's worldview and coping mechanisms. Children raised in peaceful, close-knit communities often develop a more relaxed and trusting nature. For example, growing up in the small coastal fishing village of Mituo, with its peaceful sunset walks, instilled in me a lasting appreciation for tranquility. Conversely, a high-pressure urban environment might foster a more competitive or anxious disposition. Furthermore, the social interactions and educational opportunities available during childhood provide the building blocks for future social skills. Therefore, the surrounding environment acts as a silent architect of the adult psyche.

# Q38-3:
Do you think that the pressure on children to succeed academically is increasing globally?

# A38-3:
I believe that academic pressure is indeed intensifying on a global scale, primarily due to the increasing competitiveness of the modern job market. Parents often feel that high grades and prestigious degrees are the only way to ensure their children's future financial security. For instance, during Chinese New Year, the conversation often revolves around the academic achievements of the younger relatives, highlighting this societal obsession. Moreover, the rise of global rankings and standardized testing has created a "rat race" mentality in many education systems. While academic success is important, this excessive pressure can lead to burnout and mental health issues among young students.

# Q39-1:
Why do some people prefer reading physical books rather than using electronic devices?

# A39-1:
Many people prefer physical books because they offer a tactile and sensory experience that digital devices cannot replicate. The smell of the paper, the weight of the book, and the act of physically turning pages create a deeper connection to the material. For example, I have read my deep learning textbook four times, and I find that the physical copy allows for better focus and easier annotation. Additionally, physical books do not cause eye strain and provide a necessary break from screens. Furthermore, owning a physical library can be a source of personal pride and a reflection of one's intellectual journey.

# Q39-2:
How has the way people consume literature changed with the rise of digital media?

# A39-2:
The rise of digital media has revolutionized literature consumption by making it more convenient, portable, and interactive. E-readers and audiobooks allow people to carry entire libraries in their pockets, which is particularly useful for commuters. Moreover, digital platforms have enabled a more social reading experience through online book clubs and instant reviews. However, this shift has also led to shorter attention spans, as readers are often distracted by notifications on their devices. For instance, while I use my noise-cancelling earphones to listen to podcasts and books during my commute, I sometimes find it harder to engage in deep reading compared to using a physical book.

# Q39-3:
What impact do you think film adaptations have on the popularity of original books?

# A39-3:
Film adaptations generally have a positive impact on the popularity of original books by introducing the story to a much broader audience. A successful movie can trigger a massive surge in book sales as viewers seek out the source material for more depth and detail. For example, many people only discovered certain classic novels after seeing their cinematic versions. On the other hand, a poor adaptation can sometimes tarnish the reputation of the book or lead to a simplified understanding of the plot. Overall, despite the risk of creative differences, the synergy between film and literature usually benefits the original author and the publishing industry.

# Q40-1:
What are the most significant inventions that have changed people's daily lives in recent years?

# A40-1:
In recent years, the most transformative inventions have undoubtedly been the smartphone and the integration of artificial intelligence into daily tasks. These technologies have consolidated communication, entertainment, and productivity into a single portable device. For instance, the widespread adoption of mobile payments has made physical wallets almost obsolete in many cities. Additionally, noise-cancelling earphones have significantly improved the quality of life for urban dwellers by providing a personal sanctuary in noisy environments. Moreover, AI-driven news feeds on platforms like Twitter keep us constantly updated on global developments. Consequently, these inventions have not only increased efficiency but also fundamentally altered our social interactions.

# Q40-2:
In what ways has the development of the internet affected the way people communicate?

# A40-2:
The internet has fundamentally reshaped communication by making it instantaneous, global, and increasingly visual. We are no longer limited by geographical boundaries or time zones, allowing for real-time collaboration across the world. For example, during my quantum research, I was able to present my findings to colleagues at Harvard via video conferencing without leaving my home. However, this shift has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions and the rise of "echo chambers" on social media. While we are more connected than ever, the quality of our communication can sometimes feel more superficial. Thus, the internet is a double-edged sword for human connection.

# Q40-3:
Do you think that society has become too dependent on technology to solve basic problems?

# A40-3:
I believe society has reached a point of over-dependence on technology, which may be eroding our fundamental problem-solving skills. While digital tools offer convenience, they often replace critical thinking and manual dexterity. For instance, many people now struggle to navigate without GPS, as I experienced firsthand in the Shinjuku maze. Furthermore, we often look for technological "quick fixes" for complex social or environmental issues rather than addressing the root causes. While technology is an invaluable tool, we must ensure that we maintain our basic life skills and the ability to function independently when the digital infrastructure fails.

# Q41-1:
Why do many people feel the need to visit famous tourist destinations at least once?

# A41-1:
The desire to visit famous landmarks is often driven by a combination of cultural curiosity and the influence of social media. These sites are frequently seen as "bucket list" items that validate one's travel experiences. For example, my five-day trip to Tokyo was motivated by a desire to see the iconic Shinjuku district and experience the city's unique atmosphere. Moreover, visiting these places provides a sense of shared history and connection to the global community. However, the pressure to document these visits for social media can sometimes overshadow the actual experience. Ultimately, people seek the prestige and the tangible connection to world-famous locations.

# Q41-2:
How does mass tourism affect the environment and local communities in remote areas?

# A41-2:
Mass tourism can be a double-edged sword for remote areas, providing economic opportunities while simultaneously threatening the local environment and culture. The influx of visitors often leads to increased waste, habitat destruction, and a strain on local resources. For instance, in coastal areas like Kenting, the high volume of tourists can damage fragile marine ecosystems. Furthermore, local communities may find their traditional way of life disrupted by the demands of the tourism industry. While the revenue can improve local infrastructure, it often comes at the cost of environmental degradation and the loss of cultural authenticity. Therefore, sustainable management is essential.

# Q41-3:
What role will virtual reality play in the future of the travel and tourism industry?

# A41-3:
Virtual reality is set to play a transformative role in the tourism industry, primarily as a tool for exploration and accessibility. It allows potential travelers to "preview" destinations before booking, which can help in making more informed decisions. For example, someone interested in scuba diving could use VR to experience a reef virtually before committing to a trip to Kenting. Additionally, VR can provide an immersive travel experience for those who are unable to travel due to physical or financial constraints. While it can never fully replace the sensory richness of physical travel, VR will undoubtedly become a major supplementary component of the tourism experience.

# Q42-1:
How important is it for people to have good spatial awareness and navigation skills?

# A42-1:
I believe that spatial awareness and navigation skills remain highly important, despite the prevalence of digital aids. These skills are fundamental for safety and for developing a better understanding of one's surroundings. For instance, when I was navigating the crowded venue of an anime convention in Taipei, having a good sense of direction was crucial for finding my way through the masses. Moreover, being able to read a map or orient oneself without a phone fosters a sense of independence and confidence. While technology is a great assistant, relying solely on it can make us vulnerable in situations where digital tools are unavailable or unreliable.

# Q42-2:
In what ways has the widespread use of GPS technology changed how people explore new places?

# A42-2:
GPS technology has made exploration much more efficient and less stressful, but it has also made it more linear and less spontaneous. In the past, getting lost was often part of the adventure and led to unexpected discoveries. Now, we tend to follow the fastest route suggested by an app. For example, during my trip to Tokyo, I used GPS to navigate the complex Shinjuku station, which saved time but perhaps prevented me from truly "experiencing" the layout of the area. While GPS allows us to reach our destinations with ease, it can sometimes disconnect us from the physical environment we are moving through.

# Q42-3:
Do you think that people are losing their ability to solve problems without the help of digital tools?

# A42-3:
There is a significant risk that our reliance on digital tools is weakening our innate problem-solving abilities. We have become accustomed to instant answers and automated solutions, which can lead to mental laziness. For instance, instead of trying to fix a broken joystick on my Switch myself, the first instinct for many would be to look for a professional or buy a new one. Furthermore, the ability to think critically and troubleshoot without an internet connection is a skill that is becoming increasingly rare. While technology enhances our capabilities, we must be careful not to let it replace our fundamental cognitive skills.

# Q43-1:
What are the main factors that people consider when choosing a place to live?

# A43-1:
When choosing a residence, people typically prioritize a combination of practical convenience and personal well-being. Proximity to work, quality of local schools, and access to public transportation are usually at the top of the list. However, the surrounding environment also plays a crucial role. For example, I find the peaceful atmosphere of my hometown, Mituo, very appealing because of its coastal charm and quiet streets. Additionally, safety and the cost of living are major considerations for most families. Ultimately, the ideal home is a balance between being functional for one's daily needs and providing a sense of comfort and belonging.

# Q43-2:
How has the design of residential buildings changed to accommodate growing urban populations?

# A43-2:
To accommodate the rapid growth of urban populations, residential design has shifted toward high-density, multi-functional, and vertical living. Modern apartment complexes often incorporate shared amenities like gyms, gardens, and even co-working spaces to maximize the use of limited land. For instance, in densely populated cities like Tokyo, micro-apartments and clever storage solutions have become the norm. Furthermore, there is an increasing focus on sustainable design and smart home technology to improve efficiency. While these buildings allow more people to live in the city, the challenge remains to ensure that these high-density environments still provide a high quality of life and a sense of community.

# Q43-3:
To what extent should governments be responsible for providing affordable housing for all citizens?

# A43-3:
I believe that governments have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to safe and affordable housing. Housing is a basic human right that directly impacts health, education, and economic stability. Without government intervention, the free market often fails to provide enough low-cost options, leading to homelessness and social inequality. For example, in many coastal villages like Mituo, rising property prices can push out local residents. Therefore, governments should implement policies such as rent control, public housing projects, and subsidies for first-time buyers. While it is a complex challenge, providing a stable home for everyone is essential for a healthy and productive society.

# Q44-1:
Why do you think some sports are more popular to watch than to play?

# A44-1:
Some sports are more popular as spectacles because they offer high levels of drama, skill, and entertainment that are difficult for the average person to replicate. Professional athletes perform at a level that is awe-inspiring, making the viewing experience thrilling. For instance, while I enjoy watching high-level diving competitions on YouTube for relaxation, I find the actual practice of scuba diving to be much more physically demanding and technical. Moreover, the media coverage and the sense of community among fans create a powerful social experience. Ultimately, watching sports allows people to enjoy the excitement and emotional highs without the physical strain or risk of injury.

# Q44-2:
How does the media influence the popularity of certain sports in different countries?

# A44-2:
The media plays a decisive role in shaping the sporting landscape by determining which events receive the most coverage and advertising. Sports that are frequently broadcast and heavily promoted naturally attract more fans and sponsors. For example, the global popularity of football is largely sustained by massive media deals and constant social media presence. Conversely, niche sports like scuba diving may struggle to gain a foothold without significant media exposure. Furthermore, the way the media "narrativizes" athletes and teams can create a deep emotional connection with the audience. Consequently, the media acts as a powerful gatekeeper that can elevate a sport to national or international prominence.

# Q44-3:
What impact do major international sporting events have on the economy of a host nation?

# A44-3:
Major international sporting events can provide a significant short-term boost to a host nation's economy through tourism, infrastructure investment, and job creation. The influx of international visitors generates revenue for hotels, restaurants, and local businesses. However, the long-term economic impact is often debated, as the cost of building massive stadiums and facilities can lead to significant debt. For instance, while a major event might bring prestige to a city, the "white elephant" projects left behind can become a financial burden. In conclusion, while these events can stimulate economic activity, careful planning is required to ensure that the benefits outweigh the substantial costs.

# Q45-1:
How has the growth of online shopping affected traditional brick-and-mortar stores?

# A45-1:
The rise of e-commerce has presented a formidable challenge to traditional stores, forcing many to adapt or close down. Online shopping offers unparalleled convenience, lower prices, and a wider selection of products. For example, I often use mobile payments and online platforms to buy tech gear rather than visiting a physical shop. Consequently, many brick-and-mortar stores have had to shift their focus toward providing a unique "in-store experience" that cannot be replicated online. While some sectors, like high-end fashion or groceries, still thrive in physical locations, the overall retail landscape has been permanently altered by the digital revolution.

# Q45-2:
What are the advantages of having small, independent shops compared to large shopping malls?

# A45-2:
Small, independent shops offer a level of personalized service and unique character that large malls often lack. These businesses are frequently run by passionate individuals who have a deep knowledge of their products. For instance, my elderly neighbor's book collection provides a curated experience that you simply won't find in a massive chain store. Moreover, independent shops contribute to the local economy and help maintain the unique identity of a neighborhood. While malls offer convenience and variety, small shops foster a sense of community and provide a more human-centric shopping experience. Therefore, they are essential for a vibrant and diverse urban environment.

# Q45-3:
Do you think that physical shops will eventually disappear as e-commerce continues to evolve?

# A45-3:
I do not believe that physical shops will disappear entirely, although their role will continue to evolve. While online shopping is efficient, it cannot replace the sensory experience of touching, trying on, or testing a product before purchase. For example, when I saved up to buy a PUMA jacket, the experience of trying it on in the store was a crucial part of the decision. Furthermore, shopping is often a social activity that people enjoy doing with friends or family. In the future, physical stores will likely become "showrooms" or experiential hubs where customers can interact with the brand before ultimately making a purchase online.

# Q46-1:
What makes a film successful in the eyes of the general public?

# A46-1:
A successful film usually combines a compelling narrative with high production values and relatable characters. The general public is often drawn to stories that evoke strong emotions, whether it's excitement, laughter, or empathy. For instance, a well-made documentary about the ocean can be incredibly moving and educational, as I found when watching a Netflix special on diving. Moreover, effective marketing and the presence of famous actors can significantly boost a film's initial appeal. Ultimately, a movie succeeds when it manages to resonate with the audience's personal experiences or provides a high-quality escape from reality.

# Q46-2:
How do film reviews and social media influence the choices people make at the cinema?

# A46-2:
In the digital age, film reviews and social media have a profound impact on box office performance. Word-of-mouth has been amplified by platforms like Twitter and YouTube, where a single viral review can make or break a movie. For example, I often check online ratings before deciding whether to watch a new release. Furthermore, social media influencers can create a "hype" that drives people to the cinema out of a fear of missing out. While professional critics still hold some weight, the opinions of ordinary viewers on social media are often seen as more authentic and influential by the general public.

# Q46-3:
To what extent do you think the film industry prioritizes profit over artistic quality?

# A46-3:
It is undeniable that the film industry, particularly in Hollywood, often prioritizes profit, leading to a proliferation of sequels, reboots, and formulaic blockbusters. These projects are seen as "safe" investments that are guaranteed to attract a large audience. However, there is still a significant space for artistic innovation and independent cinema. For instance, while many big-budget films feel repetitive, there are always directors who push the boundaries of storytelling and visual art. In conclusion, while the commercial nature of the industry often favors the "bottom line," the desire for artistic expression remains a powerful force that continues to produce high-quality, thought-provoking cinema.

# Q47-1:
Why do many people feel nervous when they have to speak in front of a large audience?

# A47-1:
Public speaking anxiety is a common phenomenon rooted in the fear of social judgment and the pressure to perform perfectly. The feeling of being the center of attention can trigger a "fight or flight" response, leading to physical symptoms like a racing heart or shaky hands. For example, even after presenting my quantum research at Harvard, I still feel a twinge of nerves before a big talk. Moreover, the fear of making a mistake or being perceived as incompetent can be overwhelming. Ultimately, it is a natural human reaction to a high-stakes social situation where one's reputation feels at risk.

# Q47-2:
How important is it for schools to teach public speaking and presentation skills to students?

# A47-2:
I believe that teaching public speaking is absolutely essential, as it is a fundamental skill for success in almost any career. Schools should provide a safe environment for students to practice articulating their ideas clearly and confidently. For instance, my science teacher's Wednesday experiments often required us to explain our findings to the class, which was incredibly helpful for my development. Furthermore, these skills foster critical thinking and the ability to persuade others. By equipping students with the tools to communicate effectively, schools are preparing them not just for exams, but for the challenges of the professional world and active citizenship.

# Q47-3:
In what ways can effective communication skills influence a person's career progression?

# A47-3:
Effective communication is often the key differentiator in career advancement, as it allows individuals to lead teams, negotiate deals, and present their ideas convincingly. Technical skills are important, but the ability to explain complex concepts to a non-expert audience is invaluable. For example, in my academic presentations, being able to clearly communicate my quantum research was just as important as the research itself. Moreover, good communicators are better at building professional networks and resolving workplace conflicts. Consequently, those who can articulate their vision and collaborate effectively are much more likely to be promoted into leadership positions.

# Q48-1:
What are the main challenges that young people face when they move out of their parents' home?

# A48-1:
Moving out for the first time presents a steep learning curve, primarily in terms of financial management and domestic responsibilities. Young people must learn to budget for rent, utilities, and groceries, which can be a significant shock. For instance, when my friend YiLin moved out, she found that managing daily chores while working full-time was much more demanding than expected. Additionally, the transition from a busy family home to living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Ultimately, the challenge lies in balancing the newfound freedom with the practical and emotional demands of independent adulthood.

# Q48-2:
How does living alone for the first time affect a person's sense of independence?

# A48-2:
Living alone is a transformative experience that significantly bolsters a person's sense of independence and self-reliance. It forces individuals to make their own decisions and solve problems without immediate help from others. For example, having to fix a broken appliance or manage a household budget alone builds a great deal of confidence. Moreover, it provides the space for self-discovery and the freedom to establish one's own routines and values. While it can be challenging at first, the process of overcoming these obstacles leads to a more mature and resilient personality. Thus, living alone is a crucial rite of passage toward true adulthood.

# Q48-3:
Do you think that the trend of young adults living with their parents for longer will continue?

# A48-3:
I believe this trend is likely to persist, primarily due to economic factors such as rising housing costs and stagnant wages. In many cities, it is simply not financially viable for a young person to live alone early in their career. For instance, many of my peers choose to stay at home to save money for future investments or further education. Furthermore, in some cultures, living with parents is seen as a way to provide mutual support and maintain close family ties. While it may delay the onset of full independence, it is often a pragmatic response to the economic realities of the modern world.

# Q49-1:
Why do some people enjoy attending large public events while others prefer quiet places?

# A49-1:
The preference for crowded events versus quiet spaces often comes down to individual personality traits, specifically the distinction between extroversion and introversion. Extroverts often thrive on the energy and social stimulation of large gatherings. For example, I find the vibrant atmosphere of an anime convention in Taipei to be incredibly exciting and inspiring. On the other hand, introverts may find such environments draining and prefer the peace of a quiet coastal village like Mituo to recharge. Moreover, some people seek out large events for the sense of shared experience, while others value the opportunity for deep reflection that only solitude can provide.

# Q49-2:
What are the potential problems associated with overcrowding in modern cities?

# A49-2:
Overcrowding in urban areas leads to a range of systemic issues, including strained infrastructure, increased pollution, and a decline in the quality of life. When public transport and housing are pushed to their limits, it can lead to daily stress and inefficiency for residents. For instance, navigating a packed venue or a crowded subway station can be physically and mentally exhausting. Furthermore, high population density can exacerbate environmental problems like waste management and air quality. Moreover, overcrowding can lead to a sense of anonymity and a breakdown of community ties. Therefore, managing urban growth is one of the most pressing challenges for modern city planners.

# Q49-3:
How can city planners ensure that public spaces remain safe and accessible for everyone?

# A49-3:
City planners can enhance safety and accessibility by prioritizing human-centric design and incorporating smart technology. This includes wide sidewalks, well-lit parks, and efficient public transportation systems that cater to people of all ages and abilities. For example, using noise-cancelling technology or creating "quiet zones" in busy areas can make the city more inclusive for those sensitive to noise. Additionally, the use of surveillance and emergency call points can improve public safety. Furthermore, involving the local community in the planning process ensures that the spaces meet the actual needs of the residents. Ultimately, a well-designed city should be both functional and welcoming for all its citizens.

# Q50-1:
What factors do people usually prioritize when they are looking for a new job?

# A50-1:
When seeking new employment, most people prioritize a combination of financial compensation, career growth opportunities, and work-life balance. A competitive salary is essential for security, but many also look for a role that offers intellectual challenge and the chance to learn new skills. For instance, my interest in quantum research was driven by a desire to work at the cutting edge of technology. Additionally, the company culture and the flexibility to work remotely have become increasingly important in recent years. Ultimately, the ideal job is one that aligns with an individual's personal values while providing the resources necessary for a comfortable life.

# Q50-2:
How has the concept of a "job for life" changed in the modern labor market?

# A50-2:
The traditional idea of staying with a single employer for one's entire career has largely disappeared, replaced by a more fluid and dynamic labor market. Today, workers are more likely to change jobs or even entire careers multiple times to seek better opportunities or personal fulfillment. For example, the transition from a local university to a research position at Harvard reflects the modern emphasis on global mobility and continuous learning. This shift is driven by rapid technological change and the need for businesses to be more agile. Consequently, adaptability and lifelong learning have become more important than long-term loyalty to a single company.

# Q50-3:
To what extent will automation and artificial intelligence change the types of jobs available in the future?

# A50-3:
Automation and AI are set to fundamentally transform the job market by automating routine tasks while creating new roles that require high-level human skills. While some manual and administrative jobs may disappear, there will be an increased demand for experts in AI development, data analysis, and creative problem-solving. For instance, my work in quantum machine learning is a direct result of these technological advancements. Moreover, jobs that require empathy, social intelligence, and complex decision-making, such as healthcare and education, will likely remain indispensable. In conclusion, while the nature of work will change, technology will also open up new frontiers for human innovation and collaboration.

# Q51-1:
How important is it for people to have a good relationship with their neighbors?

# A51-1:
I believe that maintaining positive relationships with neighbors is crucial for fostering a sense of security and community. Neighbors are often the first people we turn to in an emergency, and a friendly rapport can make the living environment much more pleasant. For example, my elderly neighbor, who shares stories and books, adds a great deal of warmth to our street. Moreover, good neighborly relations can lead to mutual support, such as looking after each other's homes during vacations. While modern life can be busy, taking the time to be helpful and considerate toward those living nearby is essential for a cohesive and supportive society.

# Q51-2:
In what ways has the sense of community in residential areas changed over the years?

# A51-2:
The sense of community has shifted from being based on physical proximity to being more interest-based and digital. In the past, people in small villages like Mituo knew everyone on their street and relied heavily on local social networks. However, in modern urban areas, people often don't even know their neighbors' names. Instead, they find community online or through specific hobbies. For instance, I feel a strong sense of belonging within the global AI research community, even though we are geographically dispersed. While the traditional local community may be weakening, new forms of connection are emerging that transcend physical boundaries.

# Q51-3:
Do you think that people in large cities are becoming more isolated from those living nearby?

# A51-3:
There is a strong argument that urban dwellers are becoming more socially isolated, despite living in close proximity to thousands of others. The fast-paced nature of city life and the prevalence of digital entertainment can lead people to retreat into their own private bubbles. For example, many people use noise-cancelling earphones to block out their surroundings during their commute, which further reduces the chance of spontaneous interaction. However, this isolation is often a choice made for privacy and convenience. While we may be less connected to our immediate neighbors, many people still maintain vibrant social lives through other channels. Thus, urban isolation is a complex phenomenon of modern living.
