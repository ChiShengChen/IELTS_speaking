Sample Essay (Band 7):

The global trend of population aging is accelerating, with the proportion of elderly individuals rising steadily in many nations. While some argue that this demographic shift brings certain benefits, I believe that the negative impacts on society generally outweigh the advantages, primarily due to the immense economic pressure and the burden on social services.

The most significant concern is the strain that an aging population places on government finances and healthcare systems. As the number of retirees increases, pension expenditures swell, while the demand for medical care for chronic illnesses surges. Consequently, the tax burden on the younger workforce becomes heavier, leading to an imbalance in the distribution of public resources. Furthermore, a shrinking labor force can result in a slowdown of economic growth, as businesses struggle to fill technical positions, ultimately causing a decline in overall productivity.

On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the positive contributions of older people. They offer a wealth of experience for younger generations, participate in volunteer services, and provide a stable source of consumption. However, these benefits are often insufficient to offset the structural economic pressures mentioned above. To address this, governments should implement policies such as raising the retirement age and promoting the "silver economy." Flexible retirement options, lifelong learning programs, and the development of care technologies are essential measures to mitigate the negative effects.

In conclusion, although the elderly contribute to society in various ways, the challenges related to fiscal stability, healthcare, and labor shortages are more substantial. Society must embrace policy innovation to transform these demographic challenges into opportunities for sustainable development.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

The rate of species extinction is accelerating, placing global biodiversity in a state of crisis. While some argue that resources should be concentrated on solving human problems, others believe that protecting animals from dying out is essential. In my view, these two goals are not mutually exclusive, and protecting wildlife is vital because the health of our ecosystems is directly linked to human well-being.

Protecting various species is, in essence, protecting the very ecosystems that humans rely on for survival. Every species plays a critical role in the food chain, and their disappearance can trigger a negative chain reaction. For instance, the loss of certain insects or animals can damage essential ecological services such as crop pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Furthermore, biodiversity is a crucial resource for medical and technological progress. Many modern medicines are derived from plants and animals, so extinction means losing the potential for future medical breakthroughs.

Admittedly, issues like poverty, disease, and famine are urgent and require significant resources. However, the budget for wildlife conservation is often a tiny fraction of global spending, so it is not a simple choice between one or the other. In fact, conservation efforts can often benefit local communities through ecotourism and sustainable industries. By integrating protection with poverty alleviation, such as creating jobs in community-managed nature reserves, we can achieve both goals.

In conclusion, species protection and human development are not contradictory. A healthy ecosystem is the foundation of human prosperity. Therefore, nations should incorporate ecological conservation into their broader development strategies while simultaneously addressing human problems.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

The gap between the rich and the poor is widening in many countries, leading to increased social dissatisfaction. While some believe that minimizing these wealth differences is the most effective way to build a happier society, I only partially agree. Reducing inequality is certainly beneficial, but it is not the only factor that determines collective well-being.

It is undeniable that extreme wealth inequality damages social happiness. When the gap is too large, social mobility decreases, and opportunities for quality education and healthcare become unevenly distributed. This often results in a sense of hopelessness among the lower classes, which can lead to a decline in social trust and an increase in crime rates. In contrast, the experience of Nordic countries shows that more equal societies tend to be happier overall. Their systems of high taxation and comprehensive welfare provide citizens with a strong sense of security and a high quality of life.

However, while narrowing the wealth gap is positive, happiness also depends on other critical factors such as community connection, personal freedom, and mental health. Pursuing absolute equality might inadvertently suppress innovation and economic vitality. Therefore, the focus should be on ensuring "equality of opportunity" rather than "equality of outcome." Providing free education and public healthcare are practical measures that allow individuals to succeed regardless of their background.

In conclusion, although reducing the wealth gap contributes significantly to social happiness, it is not a standalone solution. A truly happy society requires a multi-faceted approach where the government also prioritizes educational fairness, mental health support, and the strengthening of community bonds.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Modern agricultural technologies, including chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and advanced machinery, have significantly increased global food production. While these advancements help feed a growing population, there are concerns regarding their negative impact on human health. I partially agree with this view, as health risks certainly exist, but I believe they can be minimized through better management and regulation.

It is true that certain agricultural practices raise serious health concerns. Pesticide residues can enter the food chain, while excessive use of fertilizers often leads to water pollution. Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the emergence of "superbugs" that are resistant to treatment. These factors may increase the risk of cancer, disrupt endocrine systems, and contribute to the prevalence of allergies and chronic diseases. Additionally, additives in processed foods and the use of genetically modified organisms have sparked long term health worries, leading to a decline in consumer trust regarding food safety.

However, completely abandoning modern technology would likely result in severe food shortages and widespread famine. The core of the problem is often the lack of strict supervision rather than the technology itself. By implementing rigorous standards for pesticide residues and promoting organic or precision farming, we can reduce these risks. Biological pest control and other sustainable methods are also effective alternatives. In short, with proper oversight, modern agriculture can maintain high yields without compromising public health.

In conclusion, while modern agricultural technologies do pose certain health risks, these dangers are manageable. The solution is not to return to traditional farming methods, but rather to use modern tools in a smarter and more responsible way to ensure both food security and safety.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

In the modern business world, while the primary goal of any company is to maximize profits, there is an increasing expectation for them to fulfill social responsibilities. I strongly agree that businesses should look beyond their financial bottom line, as corporate social responsibility (CSR) benefits both the company and society as a whole. Commercial success and social well-being are deeply interconnected.

The activities of a business have a direct impact on the environment and the community, and they should be held accountable for these effects. Issues such as factory emissions, labor rights, and consumer safety are all tied to how a company operates. If a business acts irresponsibly, society ends up paying the price in the form of environmental pollution and health problems. On the other hand, fulfilling social responsibilities can actually support a company's long term growth. By building a positive brand image, businesses can attract top talent and increase customer loyalty, as seen in the success of companies like Patagonia.

Admittedly, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) may have limited resources, and excessive social demands could put pressure on their operations. However, social responsibility does not always require massive financial investment; even small actions can make a big difference. Standards for CSR can be scaled according to the size of the business. While large corporations can lead the way in carbon reduction, smaller businesses can focus on employee welfare and fair trade practices. Every company can find a suitable way to contribute.

In conclusion, it is both necessary and feasible for businesses to pursue social responsibilities alongside profit. Companies that act responsibly are more likely to gain a competitive advantage in the market and contribute to a more sustainable future for everyone.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Advertising has become an inescapable part of modern life, appearing across social media, television, and public spaces. While it serves certain useful functions, I believe that its negative effects slightly outweigh the positives, as the informational value of most advertisements is overshadowed by their manipulative nature and promotion of consumerism.

The primary concern with advertising is that it encourages excessive consumption and materialism. Many advertisements rely on psychological manipulation, creating anxiety and encouraging social comparison to stimulate unnecessary purchases. As a result, individuals may accumulate personal debt, contribute to environmental waste, and ironically experience decreased happiness despite buying more. Moreover, the impact on children and teenagers is particularly troubling. Fast food advertisements contribute to childhood obesity, while beauty product marketing can distort young people's body image and self-esteem.

On the other hand, advertising does offer some benefits. It provides consumers with product information, drives market competition that can lower prices, and funds free media content such as news websites and social platforms. Nevertheless, the majority of modern advertisements prioritise emotional appeal over factual information, which limits their informational value. Stricter regulation is needed rather than allowing the industry to operate freely. Measures such as banning junk food advertising targeted at children, requiring labels on digitally altered images, and restricting invasive data tracking would help restore a healthier balance.

In conclusion, while advertising plays a role in the economy and media, its negative consequences including consumerism, psychological manipulation, and harm to vulnerable groups are more significant. Society should address this through legislation and media literacy education.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

With the widespread use of mobile phones and computers, digital communication has largely replaced traditional face-to-face interaction for many people. While I partially agree that this shift has weakened certain interpersonal skills, I do not believe that people are completely losing the ability to communicate in person, as changes in communication methods do not necessarily mean the disappearance of essential social skills.

There is valid evidence that heavy reliance on digital communication has weakened some aspects of in-person interaction. Text messaging allows people to carefully edit their responses without the pressure of real-time conversation, which reduces opportunities to practise spontaneous expression. Consequently, social anxiety appears to be on the rise, and many individuals find it harder to read body language or engage in meaningful dialogue. Teenagers are especially affected, as they grow up with fewer face-to-face social experiences. This can lead to poor performance in situations like job interviews or public speaking, where real-time communication is essential.

However, it would be an exaggeration to say that face-to-face skills are being lost entirely. Many people still engage in extensive personal interaction at work, within their families, and in social settings. Additionally, digital tools have created new forms of communication, such as video conferencing, that closely resemble face-to-face exchanges. Schools could introduce more oral presentation courses, and families could establish device-free time during meals to help maintain a healthy balance.

In conclusion, while digital tools have had a noticeable impact on face-to-face communication skills, this decline is not irreversible. People need to consciously maintain personal interaction rather than passively accepting a fully digital lifestyle.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

In the digital age, electronic devices have become the primary source of information for many people. Some argue that this development renders printed books, magazines, and newspapers obsolete. However, I strongly disagree with this view, as print media continues to offer unique advantages in terms of reading quality and inclusivity that digital platforms cannot fully replicate.

Printed materials provide an immersive reading experience that is difficult to achieve on a screen. Physical books are free from the constant notifications and distractions that plague digital devices, while the tactile sensation of turning pages has been shown to enhance memory retention. Research suggests that deep learning and long-term recall are more effective when reading from paper. Furthermore, prolonged screen time causes eye strain, headaches, and other health issues, making printed materials a healthier alternative for extended reading sessions, particularly for students and researchers.

Admittedly, electronic devices offer considerable convenience and are often viewed as more environmentally friendly since they reduce the need for paper production. However, the environmental argument is not entirely straightforward. Electronic waste and the energy consumption required to manufacture and power devices also place a significant burden on the environment. Print media, on the other hand, can adopt sustainable practices such as using recycled paper and sourcing from certified sustainable forests. With government subsidies for eco-friendly printing, physical publications can become a genuinely sustainable option.

In conclusion, printed media remains indispensable for its superior reading experience and broader accessibility. Rather than replacing one format with the other, digital and print should coexist and complement each other.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Modern society is characterised by mass production, excessive consumption, and the casual disposal of goods, creating what is commonly known as a "throw-away society." This essay will examine the key causes of this phenomenon and propose practical recommendations to address it.

One major cause is the deliberate practice of planned obsolescence by manufacturers. Companies intentionally design products with limited lifespans to encourage frequent replacements. Smartphones are updated annually with minor improvements, and fast fashion brands produce low-quality clothing meant to be worn only a few times. This results in a dramatic increase in waste, a depletion of natural resources, and overflowing landfills. Another significant factor is the consumer culture that equates shopping with happiness. Advertising and social media constantly reinforce the mentality of buying new rather than repairing old items, which leads to the decline of second-hand markets and the loss of basic repair skills among the general public.

To tackle this problem, a coordinated effort from multiple levels is necessary. Governments should legislate "right to repair" laws that require manufacturers to make products repairable, impose packaging taxes, and subsidise recycling industries. Businesses can adopt circular economy models, following the example of companies like Patagonia that offer lifetime repair guarantees. At the individual level, people should develop the habit of thinking carefully before making purchases and support second-hand trading platforms. Educational institutions also have a role to play by incorporating sustainable consumption into school curricula and organising community repair workshops.

In conclusion, the throw-away society is rooted in flawed business models and consumer culture. Through legislation, corporate transformation, and consumer education, we can gradually transition towards a more sustainable way of living.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Environmental problems are becoming increasingly severe, and the question of who should bear the responsibility has become a major topic of debate. I fully agree that the central government, city governments, and individuals all have essential and irreplaceable roles to play, as environmental protection is a systemic challenge that demands collaboration at every level.

The central government is responsible for establishing national legislation and long-term environmental strategies. Cross-regional issues such as air pollution and river management require unified standards that only a national authority can enforce. This includes setting carbon emission targets, enacting comprehensive environmental laws, and participating in international climate agreements. Meanwhile, city governments are better positioned to implement these policies at the local level in ways that suit their specific circumstances. Local initiatives such as waste sorting programmes, urban green space development, and public transport planning are more responsive to the daily needs of residents and can produce immediate results.

Furthermore, the cumulative effect of individual actions should not be underestimated. Everyday choices, from refusing plastic bags to choosing public transport over private cars, collectively have an enormous environmental impact. Some may argue that individual efforts are insignificant compared to industrial pollution. However, personal behaviour shapes social norms, and consumer choices and voting patterns can ultimately push both corporations and policymakers toward greener practices. The three levels work together in a chain: national policy sets the framework, local government executes it, and individual participation brings it to life.

In conclusion, protecting the environment is a shared responsibility. Only through the cooperation of central legislation, local implementation, and personal action can we effectively address the environmental crisis facing our planet.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

As urbanisation accelerates worldwide, an increasing number of people are choosing to live in major cities. Some argue that city life is detrimental to health, and I partially agree with this view. While large cities pose genuine threats to both physical and mental well-being, they also offer medical advantages that rural areas simply cannot match.

There is strong evidence that environmental factors in big cities harm physical health. Air pollution from vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, combined with noise pollution and compromised water quality, significantly increases the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Beyond physical health, the fast pace of urban life takes a serious toll on mental well-being. The stress of high housing costs, lengthy commutes, and feelings of social isolation contribute to a growing prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among city dwellers. These psychological pressures are often overlooked but can be equally damaging.

Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that big cities also provide access to world-class medical resources that are unavailable in smaller towns. Top hospitals, specialist doctors, and cutting-edge medical equipment are concentrated in urban centres, meaning residents can receive prompt and advanced treatment when needed. Furthermore, many of the health risks associated with city living can be addressed through better urban planning. Increasing green spaces, enforcing stricter vehicle emission standards, and expanding public transport networks are all practical measures that can significantly improve the urban living environment without sacrificing the benefits of city life.

In conclusion, while the health threats of living in big cities are real and should not be dismissed, they are not beyond improvement. The key lies in whether urban governance can successfully balance economic development with the health and well-being of residents.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Natural resources such as oil, forests, and fresh water are being consumed at an alarming and ever-increasing rate. This trend is creating serious environmental and economic problems that require urgent attention. This essay will analyse the key issues arising from this overconsumption and suggest possible solutions.

The excessive use of fossil fuels is one of the most pressing concerns, as it directly accelerates climate change. Increased carbon emissions lead to global warming, which in turn triggers extreme weather events, reduces agricultural yields, and disrupts ecosystems. Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities, while species extinction is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Alongside this, deforestation and freshwater scarcity pose equally grave threats. Forests serve as vital carbon sinks and habitats for countless species, yet they are being cleared at a devastating rate. Fresh water accounts for only three percent of the Earth's total water supply, and growing demand has already led to resource conflicts in regions such as the Middle East.

Addressing these challenges requires a combination of technological innovation, policy enforcement, and international cooperation. Governments should invest heavily in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to replace fossil fuels. Strict legislation against illegal logging, supported by carbon trading systems that reward conservation, can help protect forests. For water resources, desalination technology, rainwater harvesting systems, and water-efficient irrigation methods offer practical solutions. Crucially, since resource depletion is a global problem, nations must work together to set binding reduction targets.

In conclusion, the overconsumption of natural resources has already created environmental and survival crises. Only by combining technological advances with coordinated global governance can we achieve truly sustainable development.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Traffic congestion and housing shortages are among the most serious challenges facing major cities today. Some people suggest that relocating large companies and factories, along with their employees, to the countryside could solve these problems. While I agree that this approach might offer partial relief, I believe the proposal is overly simplistic and could create significant new problems.

There is some merit to the idea of moving businesses out of cities. Reducing the number of commuters would naturally decrease traffic volumes and ease the demand for urban housing, potentially leading to lower property prices and less road congestion. Additionally, rural areas could benefit economically from the arrival of new businesses, gaining employment opportunities and helping to narrow the gap between urban and rural development. This could also slow the trend of young people migrating to cities in search of work.

However, the practical implementation of this plan faces serious obstacles. Rural areas typically lack the necessary infrastructure, including reliable transport networks, high-speed internet, quality schools, and hospitals. Most employees would be reluctant to leave the city due to concerns about their children's education, their partner's career, and their social lives. Furthermore, relocating factories to the countryside could damage the natural environment and valuable agricultural land. A more realistic alternative would be to develop satellite towns around major cities, improve public transport systems, and promote remote working arrangements.

In conclusion, while moving companies to rural areas could partially ease urban pressures, the practical challenges and unintended consequences make it an inadequate solution. Comprehensive urban planning that integrates better public transport, remote work policies, and satellite city development offers a far more effective approach.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

The idea that public transport should be entirely funded by the government and made free for all users is appealing in principle. While I agree with the underlying goal of making transport more accessible, I believe that implementing a completely free system is impractical due to the enormous financial burden and potential decline in service quality.

Free public transport would undoubtedly bring significant social benefits. By eliminating fares, low-income individuals would find it much easier to commute to work, thereby increasing their employment opportunities. Moreover, free services would encourage more people to leave their cars at home, reducing carbon emissions and easing traffic congestion. Several cities have already experimented with this model successfully. Luxembourg, for instance, made all public transport free nationwide, resulting in increased ridership and improved air quality.

Despite these advantages, making public transport universally free presents serious challenges. The financial cost would be enormous, raising difficult questions about funding sources. Would governments need to raise taxes or cut spending on other essential public services such as healthcare and education? Furthermore, free access could lead to overcrowding and increased vandalism, causing a deterioration in service quality. The financial strain might eventually force authorities to reduce routes or delay the replacement of ageing vehicles, ultimately harming the very people the policy aims to help. A more sustainable approach would be to provide free or heavily subsidised transport for low-income groups while maintaining affordable fares for the general population.

In conclusion, while the goal of free public transport is commendable, universal implementation is not financially realistic. A tiered subsidy system would better balance social equity with long-term fiscal sustainability.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Some countries invest heavily in specialised training facilities for elite athletes in pursuit of international sporting glory, often at the expense of public sports infrastructure. I believe this is largely a negative development, as it benefits only a tiny minority while neglecting the health and fitness needs of the general population.

The most obvious problem with this strategy is that it channels limited resources toward a small group of elite athletes while communities are left without adequate sports facilities. When budgets are concentrated on building state-of-the-art training centres for the few, local parks, swimming pools, and gyms receive less funding. As a consequence, ordinary citizens have fewer opportunities to exercise regularly, which can contribute to rising obesity rates, an increase in chronic diseases, and ultimately higher healthcare costs for the government. Additionally, the perceived national prestige gained from winning international medals is often overstated. Medal counts do not reflect the overall fitness level of a nation's population and fail to deliver lasting social benefits.

Supporters of this approach argue that the success of top athletes can inspire young people to take up sports. While this may be true to some extent, inspiration alone is insufficient if there are no local facilities where aspiring young athletes can actually train. A more balanced approach would be to adopt a "pyramid model," where widespread grassroots participation supports the development of elite talent. This means investing simultaneously in community sports centres, school physical education programmes, and specialised training academies.

In conclusion, sacrificing public sports facilities for the sake of international medals is a short-sighted and negative policy. A truly strong sporting nation is built on broad public participation, not just a handful of trophies.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

With the development of digital technology, people can now browse museum collections and view famous artworks from the comfort of their homes. Some claim that this makes physical museums and galleries unnecessary. I strongly disagree with this opinion, as real-world venues continue to offer irreplaceable experiences and serve essential social and educational functions.

Physical museums and galleries provide a sensory experience that digital platforms simply cannot replicate. The true scale, texture, colour, and spatial atmosphere of original artworks are impossible to convey through a computer screen. Standing before the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, for example, creates an emotional impact that is vastly different from viewing a digital image. Beyond the visitor experience, museums play a critical role in the preservation, restoration, and academic study of artefacts. Digital files cannot replace the scientific research value of physical objects, which are essential for techniques such as carbon dating and material analysis.

It is true that online museums have increased cultural accessibility, particularly for people in remote areas or those with physical disabilities. However, online viewing should serve as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the real thing. Museums also fulfil important social functions by hosting educational programmes, providing community gathering spaces, and strengthening cultural identity. Online platforms could be used as pre-visit preparation tools, encouraging more people to eventually walk through the doors of a real museum.

In conclusion, physical museums remain irreplaceable in terms of experience, preservation, and education. Digital and physical formats should coexist and support each other in the shared mission of promoting cultural heritage for future generations.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

The question of how schools should distribute academic rewards is a significant educational debate. Some believe only top-performing students deserve recognition, while others feel that weaker students who show improvement should also be rewarded. In my view, both groups deserve acknowledgement, but the reward system should be designed to distinguish between different types of achievement.

Rewarding the best students sets a high standard and motivates all learners to strive for excellence. Academic distinctions are a fair recognition of hard work and talent, and they help maintain the value of scholarly achievement. This competitive element can drive students to push their boundaries and ultimately helps society identify high-calibre individuals for future leadership roles. Critics of broader reward systems also point out that lowering the threshold for awards may dilute their significance. If everyone receives a prize, the incentive to excel diminishes.

On the other hand, recognising improvement has the power to motivate the majority of students rather than just a select few. Weaker students often start from a lower baseline, and the effort required for them to make progress can be just as great as, or even greater than, that of high achievers. Acknowledging their growth can boost their confidence and motivation while reducing dropout rates. The ideal solution is to establish different categories of awards, such as an "Academic Excellence Award" alongside a "Best Progress Award." Schools could publicly celebrate improvement and offer scholarships to students who demonstrate dedication despite difficult circumstances.

In conclusion, the reward system should not be an either-or choice. Both excellence and progress are worthy of recognition, and a diversified approach to awards is the most effective way to inspire every student to reach their full potential.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Whether children should be encouraged to compete or cooperate has long been a subject of debate in education. Some believe that a competitive spirit prepares children for the real world, while others argue that cooperation produces more useful adults. I think both qualities are important, but in the context of modern society, the ability to work collaboratively holds greater long-term value.

Moderate competition can certainly benefit children's development. It builds ambition, resilience, and goal-oriented thinking by pushing children to discover their potential and learn how to handle failure. In academic contests and sports competitions, young people develop creativity under pressure, which is a valuable workplace skill. Students who have experienced healthy rivalry tend to be better prepared for the competitive aspects of university admissions and job hunting later in life.

However, the modern workplace increasingly values teamwork over individual brilliance. Complex problems in fields such as technology, medicine, and business require cross-disciplinary collaboration, and working alone is rarely sufficient to achieve meaningful results. People who have learned to cooperate effectively find it easier to integrate into teams and develop into capable leaders. Moreover, excessive competition can produce negative outcomes including anxiety, selfishness, a fear of failure, and damaged peer relationships. The best approach is to combine both elements through team-based competitions, where children learn to cooperate within their group while competing against others. Activities such as group projects, team sports, and collaborative learning games naturally foster both skills simultaneously.

In conclusion, competition and cooperation are not opposing forces, yet cooperation is arguably more critical in today's interconnected world. Education should be grounded in collaboration, with healthy competition woven in as a complementary element.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

University enrolment rates have been climbing steadily around the world, and opinions are divided on whether this benefits a country or simply produces more unemployed graduates. I believe that higher education does bring advantages to a nation, but only when it is paired with vocational training and strong links between academia and the job market.

A well-educated population is a significant national asset. Universities cultivate critical thinking, research skills, and specialised knowledge that drive technological innovation and economic development. Countries with higher rates of tertiary education tend to be more competitive internationally and better equipped to manage economic transitions. Furthermore, statistics consistently show that university graduates enjoy higher lifetime earnings and greater job stability compared to those without degrees, indicating that the value of a university qualification has not disappeared.

Nevertheless, the rapid expansion of higher education has led to degree inflation and a mismatch between graduates' skills and market demands. When too many students compete for a limited number of white-collar positions, and their academic training is disconnected from practical requirements, the result is underemployment and mounting student debt. At the same time, there is a growing shortage of skilled workers in trades and technical fields. The issue is not that too many people attend university, but rather that the education system lacks flexibility. A more balanced approach would give equal weight to university and vocational education, creating multiple pathways for young people. Practical measures include industry partnerships for internships, upgrading vocational colleges, and embedding practical skills within university curricula.

In conclusion, university education benefits a country, but only when the system is aligned with employment needs. Diversified educational pathways combining university degrees, vocational training, and on-the-job learning represent the optimal solution.

Sample Essay (Band 7):

Advances in communication technology and transport have made it possible for people in many countries to live and work virtually anywhere they choose. While this geographical freedom brings certain challenges, I believe its advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages, as it opens up unprecedented opportunities for personal development and economic efficiency.

The most significant advantage is that geographical freedom unlocks individual potential and career opportunities. People are no longer confined to the place where they were born and can instead choose the city, country, or lifestyle that best suits their ambitions. This leads to higher personal incomes, improved quality of life, and a more efficient allocation of talent and resources across regions. Remote work, in particular, allows people to live in affordable areas while working for companies in expensive cities. This helps reduce the economic gap between urban and rural areas and eases the overcrowding pressure on major metropolitan centres.

Admittedly, this freedom of movement does carry some drawbacks. Cultural clashes, family separation, the dilution of local traditions, and housing prices being driven up by newcomers are legitimate concerns. In developing countries, brain drain can deprive communities of their most talented individuals. However, these problems can be managed through thoughtful policies rather than by restricting people's freedom. Immigration integration programmes, cultural preservation laws, and increased housing supply can all address specific issues. Additionally, remittances sent home by overseas workers and the professional networks they build abroad can actually benefit their countries of origin.

In conclusion, the geographical freedom enabled by modern technology and transport brings far more benefits than drawbacks. Countries should protect this freedom of movement while implementing targeted policies to mitigate its negative side effects.
