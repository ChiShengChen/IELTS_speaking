# Q18-1:
Why do you think some parents prefer to buy traditional wooden toys rather than electronic ones for their children?

# A18-1:
I think many parents opt for wooden toys because they are generally more durable and safer for younger children. Unlike electronic gadgets that often break easily or have small, fragile parts, wooden blocks or trains can last for generations. Moreover, these traditional toys tend to encourage more open-ended play. While an electronic toy might only do one specific thing, a set of wooden blocks allows a child to build anything they can imagine. In my experience, playing with simple rubber band guns as a kid was far more engaging than many flashing plastic toys because it required more active participation and creativity.

# Q18-2:
In what ways have the types of toys children play with changed compared to those of previous generations?

# A18-2:
The landscape of play has shifted dramatically, primarily due to the digital revolution. In the past, children mostly played with physical objects like dolls, marbles, or outdoor equipment. However, nowadays, a significant portion of playtime is spent on screens or with highly sophisticated electronic devices. For instance, while I enjoyed physical toys, I also spent a lot of time on my Nintendo Switch, which offers a completely different level of immersion. Furthermore, modern toys are often more educational and interactive, designed to teach coding or logic, whereas older toys were perhaps more focused on basic motor skills and social interaction through group games.

# Q18-3:
To what extent do you agree that toys play a critical role in the cognitive development of a child?

# A18-3:
I strongly agree that toys are essential tools for a child's mental growth. They aren't just for entertainment; they are the primary way children learn about the world. For example, puzzles and building sets help develop spatial awareness and problem-solving skills. Moreover, role-playing with dolls or action figures fosters empathy and social understanding. Although some might argue that human interaction is more important, toys provide the necessary stimulation for independent exploration. When I was younger, even simple DIY joystick repairs taught me basic mechanics and logic, showing how even the maintenance of toys can be a valuable learning experience.

# Q19-1:
How important is it for people to consider the personality of a friend when choosing a gift for them?

# A19-1:
From my perspective, it's absolutely vital to tailor a gift to a friend's unique character. A well-thought-out present shows that you truly understand and value the person. If you give a generic gift, it might come across as lazy or impersonal. For instance, when I went on a trip to Tokyo with my friend YiLin, I made sure to pick out something that matched her specific interests in Japanese stationery rather than just buying a standard souvenir. By considering their hobbies and temperament, you ensure the gift is actually useful and meaningful, which ultimately strengthens the bond of friendship.

# Q19-2:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving money instead of a physical gift on special occasions?

# A19-2:
Giving money is certainly practical because it allows the recipient to buy exactly what they need or want, which avoids the risk of giving a useless item. This is particularly common during events like Chinese New Year, where red envelopes are a tradition. On the other hand, cash can sometimes feel a bit cold or transactional, lacking the personal touch that a physical gift carries. While a physical gift shows effort and thought, money might suggest that the giver didn't want to spend time searching for something special. Therefore, while it's efficient, it might not always convey the same level of emotional warmth.

# Q19-3:
Do you think the commercialization of gift-giving has changed the way people perceive the value of friendship?

# A19-3:
Unfortunately, I believe the heavy commercialization of holidays has shifted the focus toward the price tag rather than the sentiment. Many people now feel pressured to buy expensive items to prove their affection, which is quite a shallow way to measure a relationship. However, true friendship shouldn't be defined by material exchange. Although advertisements try to convince us that "bigger is better," the most memorable gifts are often those that carry personal significance. For example, attending an anime convention in Taipei with friends was a shared experience that I valued far more than any physical merchandise we could have bought for each other.

# Q20-1:
Why do you think some people find it much easier to learn a foreign language than others?

# A20-1:
I think it often comes down to a combination of natural aptitude and the environment. Some individuals seem to have a "musical ear" that helps them pick up tones and pronunciation more quickly. Moreover, those who are more extroverted tend to progress faster because they aren't afraid to make mistakes while speaking. In my experience, using tools like noise-cancelling earphones to listen to podcasts in a target language can significantly boost immersion. While some struggle with grammar rules, others might find that their passion for a specific culture, like Japanese anime, provides the necessary motivation to overcome the initial difficulties of learning.

# Q20-2:
How has the use of technology changed the way languages are taught in schools today?

# A20-2:
Technology has completely transformed the classroom experience by making it more interactive and accessible. Instead of just relying on dusty textbooks, students can now use apps, watch authentic videos, and even video-chat with native speakers across the globe. This makes the learning process much more dynamic. For instance, during my 5-day Tokyo trip, I realized how much more effective it is to use digital translators and maps in real-time. Furthermore, teachers can now use multimedia presentations to cater to different learning styles, which helps students retain information better than traditional rote memorization methods used in the past.

# Q20-3:
Do you think that a global language will eventually replace the need for people to learn minority languages?

# A20-3:
While English has certainly become a global lingua franca, I don't think it will ever fully replace minority languages. Language is deeply tied to cultural identity and heritage, so people will always have a desire to preserve their mother tongues. However, it is true that many smaller languages are at risk of disappearing as younger generations prioritize global communication. Although a universal language makes international business and travel easier, losing minority languages would mean losing unique ways of seeing the world. Therefore, while the dominance of a global language is inevitable, the cultural value of local dialects remains irreplaceable.

# Q21-1:
What role does music play in the cultural identity of a nation?

# A21-1:
Music is a powerful symbol of a nation's history and values. It often reflects the struggles, triumphs, and daily lives of its people. For example, traditional folk songs can tell stories that have been passed down for centuries, preserving a sense of continuity. Moreover, modern music scenes can also define a country's global image, like how J-pop or K-pop has become synonymous with their respective cultures. In my experience, attending a packed anime convention in Taipei showed me how music can unite a specific subculture within a nation, creating a shared sense of belonging and pride among fans.

# Q21-2:
How has the way people consume music changed with the rise of digital streaming platforms?

# A21-2:
The shift from physical albums to digital streaming has made music incredibly accessible but also somewhat disposable. In the past, people would buy a CD and listen to it repeatedly, whereas now, we have millions of songs at our fingertips for a small monthly fee. This means we are exposed to a much wider variety of genres. For instance, I often spend hours on YouTube watching music videos or discovering new artists while baking. However, this convenience sometimes leads to a shorter attention span, as people tend to skip tracks more frequently rather than appreciating a full album as a cohesive work of art.

# Q21-3:
To what extent do you agree that music has the power to influence the behavior and emotions of a society?

# A21-3:
I believe music has a profound impact on both individual moods and collective social movements. It can be used to energize a crowd at a sporting event or to provide comfort during times of national mourning. Moreover, lyrics often reflect and shape social attitudes toward important issues. Although some might see it as mere entertainment, music can actually drive change by raising awareness. For example, during my time doing research at Harvard, I found that listening to certain types of ambient music helped me focus on complex Quantum ML problems, illustrating how sound can directly influence cognitive performance and emotional state.

# Q22-1:
How important is it for individuals to have clear ambitions in their professional lives?

# A22-1:
Having clear goals is crucial because it provides a sense of direction and motivation. Without ambition, it's easy to become stagnant or dissatisfied in one's career. When you have a target, you can make more informed decisions about which skills to develop or which opportunities to pursue. For instance, my ambition to conduct Quantum ML research at Harvard required years of focused study and planning. Moreover, having a vision for the future helps individuals stay resilient when they face setbacks. While it's important to be flexible, a clear sense of purpose is often the key to long-term professional success and personal fulfillment.

# Q22-2:
What are the main factors that prevent people from achieving their long-term goals?

# A22-2:
I think the biggest obstacles are often a lack of persistence and the fear of failure. Many people start with great enthusiasm but give up when things get difficult or when they don't see immediate results. Additionally, external factors like financial constraints or family responsibilities can also play a significant role. For example, someone might want to travel extensively, but a demanding job makes it impossible. Moreover, a lack of clear planning can lead to wasted effort. Although talent is important, the ability to stay disciplined and focused over a long period is what usually separates those who succeed from those who don't.

# Q22-3:
Do you think society puts too much pressure on young people to be successful at an early age?

# A22-3:
Yes, I definitely think there is an overwhelming amount of pressure on the younger generation today. Social media often showcases "overnight successes," which creates unrealistic expectations. This can lead to high levels of stress and burnout before people even reach their thirties. For instance, at the anime convention in Taipei, I saw many young creators working incredibly hard to gain recognition in a very crowded venue. While ambition is good, we should also value the process of learning and growing at one's own pace. After all, success is a marathon, not a sprint, and everyone's timeline is different.

# Q23-1:
Why do you think it is necessary for schools and workplaces to have a strict set of rules?

# A23-1:
Rules are essential for maintaining order and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. In a school setting, regulations help create a safe environment where students can focus on learning without distractions. Similarly, in the workplace, clear guidelines prevent chaos and ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. For example, when I worked as a science teacher, having strict safety rules for our Wednesday experiments was non-negotiable to prevent accidents. Moreover, rules provide a framework for professional behavior, which is vital for teamwork. Although they can sometimes feel restrictive, they ultimately protect the interests of the entire community.

# Q23-2:
How can a lack of flexibility in regulations affect the productivity and morale of employees?

# A23-2:
While rules are necessary, being too rigid can actually be counterproductive. If employees feel like they are being micromanaged or that their unique circumstances aren't considered, their motivation will likely drop. This can lead to a "work-to-rule" attitude where people only do the bare minimum. For instance, if a company has a strict 9-to-5 policy with no room for remote work, it might lose talented individuals who need more flexibility. Moreover, a lack of autonomy can stifle creativity. Therefore, it's important for management to find a balance between maintaining order and allowing employees the freedom to work in ways that suit them best.

# Q23-3:
Do you think that rules in society will become more or less relaxed in the future?

# A23-3:
That's an interesting question. I think it depends on the area of life. In terms of social norms and personal expression, I believe rules are becoming more relaxed as society becomes more inclusive. However, when it comes to things like data privacy and environmental protection, we are seeing much stricter regulations being implemented. For example, as technology advances, governments are finding it necessary to create new laws to manage AI and digital security. So, while we might have more freedom in how we live our lives, the legal frameworks governing our digital and physical worlds will likely become more complex and stringent.

# Q24-1:
What are some things, other than technology, that people in your country consider essential for daily life?

# A24-1:
Aside from gadgets, I think social connections and good food are seen as absolutely essential. In many cultures, sharing a meal with family or friends is the highlight of the day. For instance, during CNY, playing games with the whole family is a tradition that people wouldn't trade for any piece of technology. Moreover, access to nature and clean air is increasingly valued. People also rely heavily on reliable public infrastructure, like transportation and healthcare. While we use our phones for everything, the underlying human needs for community, health, and physical comfort remain the true essentials that keep society functioning smoothly.

# Q24-2:
How does the level of consumerism in a society affect what people believe they cannot live without?

# A24-2:
High levels of consumerism tend to blur the line between "needs" and "wants." Constant advertising convinces us that we require the latest products to be happy or successful. For example, many people feel they can't live without noise-cancelling earphones or the newest smartphone, even if their old ones work perfectly fine. This creates a cycle of endless consumption. Moreover, it can lead to a sense of inadequacy if one cannot afford the latest trends. In my experience, even something as simple as a Nintendo Switch can feel like a "must-have" because of the social pressure to join in on popular games and trends.

# Q24-3:
To what extent do you think people's reliance on physical possessions has increased over the last few decades?

# A24-3:
I think it's a bit of a paradox. On one hand, we have more "stuff" than ever before due to mass production and online shopping. On the other hand, many of our possessions have become digital, like books, music, and photos. However, the psychological reliance on having the "right" brands or the latest gear seems to have intensified. For instance, my PUMA jacket was something I saved my allowance for because it felt essential for my identity at school. Although we might own fewer physical CDs or DVDs, our attachment to high-end hardware and trendy clothing has certainly grown as these items have become status symbols.

# Q25-1:
What qualities make a teacher effective at delivering a memorable lesson?

# A25-1:
I believe passion and the ability to simplify complex concepts are the most important traits. A teacher who genuinely loves their subject can make even the most boring topic interesting. For example, when I was a science teacher, I found that doing hands-on Wednesday experiments made the lessons much more memorable for my students than just reading from a book. Moreover, a good teacher should be empathetic and able to connect with students on a personal level. By creating a supportive and engaging atmosphere, they can inspire curiosity and a lifelong love of learning, which is far more impactful than just helping students pass an exam.

# Q25-2:
In what ways does the environment of a classroom affect the ability of students to retain information?

# A25-2:
The physical and emotional atmosphere of a classroom plays a huge role in learning. A cluttered or noisy room can be very distracting, making it hard for students to focus. Conversely, a bright, well-organized space can enhance concentration. Moreover, the "social environment" is just as important; students need to feel safe to ask questions and make mistakes. During my 5-day Tokyo trip, I took a cake class where the calm, professional kitchen environment made it much easier to follow the intricate steps. If the environment is stressful or uncomfortable, the brain's ability to process and store new information is significantly hindered.

# Q25-3:
Do you think that traditional classroom-based learning will eventually be replaced by online education?

# A25-3:
While online education offers incredible flexibility and access to resources, I don't think it will ever fully replace the traditional classroom. There is a certain "human element" to in-person learning that is hard to replicate through a screen. For instance, the immediate feedback from a teacher and the social interaction with peers are vital for developing soft skills. Although online courses are great for specific technical skills or for people with busy schedules, the structured environment of a physical school provides a sense of community and discipline. Therefore, I believe a "hybrid" model will become the standard rather than a total replacement.

# Q26-1:
Why do some people feel a strong sense of responsibility to help others in their local community?

# A26-1:
I think it often stems from a desire for social connection and a belief in the "common good." When people help their neighbors, they are essentially investing in the stability and happiness of their own environment. For example, I have an elderly neighbor who collects and redistributes books to everyone in our building, which creates a wonderful sense of community. Moreover, some people are motivated by their upbringing or religious beliefs that emphasize altruism. By contributing to the well-being of others, individuals often find a sense of purpose and fulfillment that they can't get from purely self-interested activities.

# Q26-2:
How has the level of neighborliness in urban areas changed over the last few years?

# A26-2:
In many large cities, the sense of community has unfortunately declined as people become busier and more focused on their private lives. Many residents don't even know the names of the people living next door. However, technology has also created new ways to connect, such as neighborhood apps or social media groups. While traditional "over-the-fence" chats might be rarer, people still come together during crises. For instance, my elderly neighbor's book-sharing initiative shows that small acts of kindness can still thrive even in a fast-paced urban setting. So, while the form of neighborliness has changed, the underlying need for local support remains.

# Q26-3:
What role should the government play in encouraging citizens to participate in voluntary work?

# A26-3:
The government can play a vital role by providing the necessary infrastructure and incentives for volunteering. For example, they could offer tax breaks for companies that allow employees to volunteer during work hours or provide grants to local community projects. Moreover, integrating community service into the school curriculum can help foster a culture of giving from a young age. When I was a science teacher, I encouraged my students to help out with local environmental projects. By recognizing and rewarding the efforts of volunteers, the government can signal that these contributions are highly valued, which in turn motivates more people to get involved.

# Q27-1:
What are the main reasons why some people become popular or famous in their local communities?

# A27-1:
Local fame often comes from being consistently helpful or having a unique talent that benefits the community. For instance, a well-liked teacher or a successful small business owner can become a household name. In my neighborhood, an elderly neighbor became popular simply because she collects and redistributes books, which made her a central figure in our social circle. Moreover, people who are active in local politics or who organize community events often gain a lot of recognition. Ultimately, it's about being visible and making a positive impact on the lives of the people around you, which builds a strong reputation over time.

# Q27-2:
How does being a popular figure in society affect an individual's right to privacy?

# A27-2:
Being in the public eye almost always comes at the cost of personal privacy. When someone becomes famous, the public often feels entitled to know every detail of their lives. This can be incredibly stressful, as even simple activities like going to the grocery store can become a spectacle. For example, at the anime convention in Taipei, the VIP guests were constantly surrounded by fans and photographers, leaving them with very little "down time." While some people enjoy the attention, the constant scrutiny can lead to a feeling of being "always on," which can take a toll on one's mental health and personal relationships.

# Q27-3:
Do you think that the qualities people look for in a role model have changed over time?

# A27-3:
I think there has been a shift from admiring distant, "perfect" figures to valuing authenticity and relatability. In the past, role models were often historical heroes or unreachable celebrities. Nowadays, however, people are more inspired by those who are open about their struggles and failures. For instance, a science teacher who admits they don't have all the answers but is willing to experiment alongside their students can be a powerful role model. Moreover, with the rise of social media, we now look for people who use their platform for social good rather than just for personal gain or fame.

# Q28-1:
How important is it for children to have positive experiences during their early years?

# A28-1:
Early childhood experiences are the foundation upon which a person's entire life is built. Positive memories and a supportive environment help children develop a sense of security and self-worth. If a child feels loved and encouraged, they are much more likely to grow into a confident and resilient adult. For example, attending an anime convention in Taipei as a young fan was a thrilling experience that fueled my passion for creativity. Moreover, these early joys provide a "buffer" against the stresses of later life. Although we can't protect children from everything, ensuring they have a happy start is the best way to set them up for success.

# Q28-2:
In what ways do childhood memories influence the personality and behavior of an adult?

# A28-2:
Our early memories often shape our values, fears, and even our career choices. For instance, my fond memories of my science teacher's experiments directly influenced my decision to go into research. Moreover, the way we were treated by adults as children often dictates how we interact with others later in life. If someone had a very competitive childhood, they might carry that drive into their professional life. On the other hand, positive social experiences, like playing group games during CNY, can foster a strong sense of teamwork and community. Essentially, our past experiences act as a lens through which we view and react to the world.

# Q28-3:
Do you think that children today have more opportunities for happy experiences than children in the past?

# A28-3:
In many ways, yes, because of the incredible variety of entertainment and educational resources available now. Children can explore any hobby they want through the internet or attend specialized events like anime conventions. However, I also think modern life is more structured and pressured, which can take away from the simple, spontaneous joy of play. While I had a blast with my Nintendo Switch, I also cherish the simple times playing with rubber band guns. So, while there are more "organized" opportunities for happiness today, the "free-range" childhood of the past had its own unique brand of joy that is becoming harder to find.

# Q29-1:
Why do you think many people still enjoy playing traditional games even though digital games are available?

# A29-1:
I think traditional games offer a level of physical interaction and social bonding that digital ones can't quite match. There's something special about sitting around a table with family during CNY and playing a board game or a card game. It's not just about the game itself, but the conversation and laughter that happen alongside it. Moreover, traditional games are often simpler and more tactile, which can be a nice break from the constant stimulation of screens. For instance, even though I love my Nintendo Switch, I still find a lot of satisfaction in the physical challenge of a DIY project or a classic tabletop game.

# Q29-2:
How does playing competitive games as a child prepare an individual for adult life?

# A29-2:
Competitive games teach children how to handle both success and failure with grace. They learn that winning requires effort and strategy, but also that losing is a natural part of life and an opportunity to learn. For example, playing intense games on the Nintendo Switch taught me the importance of persistence and practice. Moreover, these games often require teamwork and communication, which are essential skills in any workplace. By navigating the "highs and lows" of competition in a safe environment, children develop the emotional resilience and social intelligence needed to face the challenges of the adult world.

# Q29-3:
To what extent do you agree that games should be used as a primary tool for education in schools?

# A29-3:
I think games are an incredibly powerful tool for engagement, but they shouldn't be the *only* method used. "Gamification" can make difficult subjects like math or science much more appealing to students. For instance, when I was a science teacher, I often turned experiments into a sort of game to keep the class motivated. However, some topics require deep, focused study and critical thinking that a fast-paced game might not provide. Although games can introduce concepts and build excitement, traditional methods like reading and discussion are still necessary for a comprehensive understanding. Therefore, games should be a key part of a balanced educational toolkit.

# Q30-1:
What are the advantages of traveling by car compared to using public transport for long journeys?

# A30-1:
The primary advantage is definitely the flexibility and privacy it offers. When you drive, you can choose your own route, stop whenever you want, and carry as much luggage as you need. For example, when I go scuba diving in Kenting, the 3-hour drive is much more convenient because I can bring all my heavy gear without worrying about bus schedules. Moreover, a car provides a personal space where you can listen to your own music or have private conversations. Although public transport is often cheaper and better for the environment, the sheer convenience of a car makes it the preferred choice for many long-distance travelers.

# Q30-2:
How has the increase in car ownership affected the environment and the layout of modern cities?

# A30-2:
The surge in car ownership has led to significant environmental challenges, such as air pollution and increased carbon emissions. In terms of urban planning, cities have become more spread out, with vast areas dedicated to roads and parking lots rather than green spaces or pedestrian zones. This "urban sprawl" often makes it difficult to get around without a vehicle. For instance, during my 5-day Tokyo trip, I noticed how the city's incredible public transport system allowed for a much more compact and walkable layout compared to car-dependent cities. While cars offer freedom, their dominance has fundamentally changed our environment and the way we design our living spaces.

# Q30-3:
Do you think that autonomous or self-driving cars will become the standard mode of transport in the future?

# A30-3:
I believe it's highly likely, although it might take several decades to fully implement. The potential for increased safety and efficiency is too great to ignore. If cars can communicate with each other, we could see a massive reduction in traffic accidents and congestion. Moreover, it would allow people to use their commute time more productively, perhaps by catching up on work or listening to podcasts with noise-cancelling earphones. However, there are still significant technical and ethical hurdles to overcome. Although the transition will be slow, the convenience of "hands-free" travel will eventually make self-driving technology the norm for most people.

# Q31-1:
What are the most common types of important decisions that young people have to make today?

# A31-1:
Young people today face a lot of pressure regarding their education and career paths. Choosing a major or deciding whether to pursue a postgraduate degree, like my Quantum ML research at Harvard, are life-altering choices. Moreover, they have to make significant financial decisions, such as how to manage student loans or when to start investing. Socially, they also face choices about where to live and how to balance their personal lives with their professional ambitions. For instance, my friend YiLin had to decide whether to move to Tokyo for work, which was a huge step. These decisions are often complicated by the sheer number of options available.

# Q31-2:
How does the availability of too much information make the decision-making process more difficult?

# A31-2:
While having information is good, "analysis paralysis" is a real problem in the digital age. When you have thousands of reviews and opinions at your fingertips, it can be overwhelming to filter out what's actually relevant. For example, when planning my 5-day Tokyo trip, the Shinjuku maze of options for hotels and restaurants was almost too much to handle. Moreover, conflicting information can lead to doubt and anxiety. Instead of making a choice and moving forward, people often spend too much time worrying if there's a "better" option out there. Sometimes, having fewer, high-quality choices is actually more helpful than having infinite ones.

# Q31-3:
To what extent should people rely on their intuition rather than logic when making life-changing choices?

# A31-3:
I think a balance of both is ideal. Logic is essential for evaluating practical factors like finances or career prospects. However, intuition often reflects our deepest values and desires, which logic might overlook. For instance, when I decided to attend the anime convention in Taipei, it wasn't a "logical" financial decision, but my gut told me it would be a valuable experience. Although you should always do your research, if a choice feels "wrong" despite looking good on paper, it's worth listening to that feeling. Ultimately, the best decisions are usually those where your head and your heart are in agreement.

# Q32-1:
What are the most common sources of incorrect information in the modern world?

# A32-1:
Social media is undoubtedly the biggest culprit, as rumors and "fake news" can spread globally in seconds. Because these platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, sensationalist or misleading content often goes viral. Moreover, biased news outlets can also be a source of misinformation by presenting only one side of a story. In my experience, even well-meaning people can share incorrect info simply because they didn't fact-check it. For example, at the packed anime convention in Taipei, there were often conflicting rumors about VIP guest appearances. Without a reliable, central source of truth, it's very easy for false information to take root and cause confusion.

# Q32-2:
How can the spread of false information on social media affect the stability of a society?

# A32-2:
Misinformation can be incredibly damaging because it erodes trust in institutions and creates deep divisions between people. When people can't agree on basic facts, it becomes almost impossible to have a constructive dialogue about important issues. This can lead to social unrest or even influence the outcome of elections. For instance, false health information can have life-or-death consequences. Although social media connects us, it also creates "echo chambers" where people only see information that confirms their existing biases. Therefore, the unchecked spread of lies can undermine the very foundations of a stable and functioning democracy.

# Q32-3:
What measures should be taken to ensure that the public has access to reliable and accurate news?

# A32-3:
I think it requires a multi-pronged approach. First, tech companies need to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, perhaps by using AI to flag suspicious information. Second, we need to prioritize media literacy in schools so that people learn how to critically evaluate the sources they read. For example, as a science teacher, I always taught my students to look for peer-reviewed evidence. Finally, supporting independent, high-quality journalism is essential. While the internet has made news "free," we must realize that accurate reporting requires time and resources. By valuing truth over clicks, we can begin to combat the tide of misinformation.

# Q33-1:
Why do some people feel the need to give very expensive gifts to show their appreciation?

# A33-1:
In many cases, it's a way of signaling status or the depth of one's commitment. People often believe that the more they spend, the more they are showing how much they value the recipient. For instance, I remember saving up my allowance for a long time just to buy a PUMA jacket because I wanted to show I was part of a certain social group. Moreover, in some cultures, there is a strong social expectation to give lavish gifts for weddings or major milestones. However, while an expensive gift can be impressive, it doesn't always reflect the true sentiment behind the gesture, which is often more about the thought than the price.

# Q33-2:
How does the culture of giving expensive gifts vary between different countries or societies?

# A33-2:
The expectations around gift-giving are deeply rooted in cultural traditions. In some East Asian societies, for example, there is a complex system of "reciprocity" where the value of a gift is carefully noted and often matched in the future. This can create a lot of social pressure. On the other hand, in many Western cultures, the emphasis is often more on the personal or "sentimental" value of the gift. However, even there, luxury brands are often used as status symbols. For instance, during my 5-day Tokyo trip, I noticed how beautifully wrapped even small gifts were, showing that the presentation and the brand name carry a lot of weight in Japanese culture.

# Q33-3:
Do you think that the sentimental value of a gift is becoming less important than its financial cost?

# A33-3:
Sadly, I think the rise of consumerism has made people more focused on the "market value" of things. We are constantly bombarded with ads for luxury goods, which can make a simple, handmade gift feel "not good enough." However, I still believe that the most meaningful presents are those that show a deep understanding of the person. For example, my elderly neighbor's gift of a rare book was far more valuable to me than any expensive gadget because it was so personal. Although society might push us toward expensive items, the emotional connection that a thoughtful gift creates is something that money simply cannot buy.

# Q34-1:
How important is it for people to follow the latest fashion trends in their choice of clothing?

# A34-1:
From my perspective, it's not essential, but it can be a fun way to express oneself. Following trends allows people to feel like they belong to a certain group or to stay "current." For instance, when I got my PUMA jacket, it was definitely because it was the "in" thing at school. However, I think it's more important to develop a personal style that makes you feel comfortable and confident. While fashion can be a form of art, being a "slave to trends" can be expensive and exhausting. Ultimately, clothes should serve the wearer, not the other way around, and true style is about more than just wearing what's on the runway.

# Q34-2:
In what ways can the clothes a person wears influence the way they are perceived by others in a professional setting?

# A34-2:
Whether we like it or not, people often make snap judgments based on appearance. In a professional environment, dressing appropriately signals that you are serious, respectful, and detail-oriented. For example, if I were presenting my Quantum ML research at a conference, I would choose more formal attire to reflect the importance of the work. Moreover, wearing the "right" clothes can give you a boost of confidence, which in turn affects how you carry yourself. Although your skills are what truly matter, a professional appearance can open doors and help you build trust with colleagues and clients more quickly.

# Q34-3:
To what extent do you think the global fashion industry contributes to environmental problems?

# A34-3:
I believe the fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors to environmental degradation today. The rise of "fast fashion" has led to a massive increase in waste, as clothes are produced cheaply and discarded quickly. Moreover, the production process uses vast amounts of water and harmful chemicals. For instance, the sheer volume of merchandise at an anime convention in Taipei made me realize how much "stuff" is constantly being created. Although some brands are moving toward sustainability, the overall model of the industry is still based on overconsumption. Therefore, we need a major shift in both corporate practices and consumer habits to protect our planet's future.
